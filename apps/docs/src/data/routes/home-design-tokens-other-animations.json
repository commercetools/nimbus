Longer durations allow for smoother, more deliberate\nmotion but can feel sluggish if overused.\n\nFinding the right balance is key—durations should match the context and intent\nof the interaction. They’re measured in seconds or milliseconds and are often\npaired with easings to create harmonious, intentional animations.\n\n<DurationTokenDemo />\n\n## Easings\n\n_Easings_ determine **the rate of change** of an animation over time,\nessentially defining how an animation transitions between its start and end\nstates.\n\nInstead of moving linearly, animations can accelerate, decelerate, or follow\ncomplex curves, making the motion feel more dynamic and natural.\n\nThis is achieved through mathematical easing functions, like linear\ninterpolation or bezier curves, which map progress over time to the visible\nchange in animation properties.
