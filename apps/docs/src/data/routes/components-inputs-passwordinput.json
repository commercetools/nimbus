Avoid using placeholder text as\n  the sole label.\n- **Visual obscuring:** Ensure entered characters are masked by default for\n  security.\n- **Password visibility toggle:** Provide a clear and easily accessible button\n  to allow users to temporarily view the password they've typed. This helps\n  prevent errors.\n- **Contextual help:** Display this requirement clearly upfront if there are\n  particular details that users need to be mindful of such as length or\n  inclusion of special characters.\n- **Inline validation:** When applicable, offer real-time feedback as users\n  type, indicating whether they meet the password requirements.\n- **Clear error handling:** If the entered password is incorrect, provide a\n  clear and helpful error message that doesn't reveal too much information about\n  why it's wrong.\n- **Password reset link:** Make the \"Forgot Password\" link easily discoverable\n  near the password input field.\n- **Allow pasting:** Generally, allow users to paste passwords from password\n  managers.\n- **Accessibility:** Ensure the password field and its associated elements\n  (label, toggle, error messages) are accessible to users with disabilities,\n  including screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.\n\n## Usage\n\nA password field provides a secure text input for users to enter confidential\ncredentials, visually obscuring the typed characters to protect them from being\nseen by others.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> When to use\n- **Authentication:** For securely entering credentials when logging into\n  accounts or accessing protected information.\n- **Account creation:** When users are setting up new accounts and need to\n  define a secret password.\n- **Sensitive data entry:** In situations where users need to input confidential\n  information that should not be visible to others.\n- **Confirmation of sensitive actions:** Occasionally used to re-authenticate\n  users before performing critical actions.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> When not to use\n- **Non-sensitive text entry:** For regular text input where privacy is not a\n  concern (e.g., usernames, search queries, messages). Use a standard text input\n  field instead.\n- **Displaying existing passwords:** Never use a password input to show a user\n  their currently saved password by default (unless using the \"Show password\"\n  toggle).\n- **Forced complexity rules without explanation:** Avoid requiring complex\n  passwords in a password input without clearly explaining the rules before the\n  user types.\n\n## Password labeling and messaging\n\nBest practices for password input labeling involve using clear, persistent\nlabels and providing concise, helpful error messages that guide users to meet\npassword requirements without revealing security vulnerabilities.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> **Do**\n>\n> - Do use clear and visible labels outside the input field.\n> - Do use inline validation to give immediate feedback.\n> - Do make the \"Forgot Password\" link easily accessible.\n\n![](/images/password-input/password-input-labelling-do.png)\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> **Don't**\n>\n> - Don't use placeholder text as the sole label.\n> - Don't provide overly specific error messages that could reveal security\n>   information (e.g., \"Your password needs a special character\").\n\n![](/images/password-input/password-input-labelling-dont.png)\n\n## Password requirements and view\n\nPassword requirements clearly communicate the rules for creating a secure\npassword, while password viewing provides a temporary way for users to check\ntheir input for accuracy.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> **Do**\n>\n> - Do enforce a reasonable minimum password length.\n> - Do provide clear, upfront feedback on password requirements.\n> - If possible include real time validation for the requirements for password\n>   creation.\n> - Do mask the entered characters by default (e.g., with asterisks or dots).\n> - Do provide a \"Show Password\" toggle for users to verify their input.\n\n![](/images/password-input/password-input-requirements-do.png)\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> **Don't**\n>\n> - Don't enforce overly complex password rules without clear explanation.\n> - Don't use password fields for non-sensitive information.\n> - Don't auto-submit the form when the password field is filled.\n> - Don't reveal the password by default.\n> - Don't make the \"Show Password\" toggle difficult to find or use.\n\n![](/images/password-input/password-input-requirements-dont.png)\n\n### Properties\n\n<PropsTable id=\"PasswordInput\" />\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAccessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by\neveryone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,\ncognitive, and physical limitations.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <PasswordInput\n    placeholder=\"Enter a password\"\n    autoComplete=\"current-password\"\n    aria-label=\"Password\"\n  />\n);\n```\n\n### Accessibility standards\n\n- Always provide a visible label for the input.\n- Clearly associate the label with the input using the for attribute on the\n  `<label>` and a matching id on the `<input type=\"password\">`.\n- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all elements (text, borders, icons, focus\n  indicators).\n- Clearly indicate the focused state.\n- Support keyboard navigation:\n  - Use Tab to navigate to and from the input.\n  - Allow users to copy, cut, and paste using standard keyboard shortcuts\n    (Ctrl/Cmd + C, Ctrl/Cmd + X, Ctrl/Cmd + V).\n- Communicate errors clearly, using both visual cues (e.g., color) and\n  descriptive error messages.\n- Provide a toggle to show/hide password characters. Ensure this toggle is\n  keyboard accessible and clearly labeled (e.g., \"Show password\" / \"Hide\n  password\").\n- Use autocomplete=\"current-password\" or autocomplete=\"new-password\" as\n  appropriate to allow browsers and password managers to offer autofill.\n- Avoid automatically masking pasted content.\n- Do not disable the paste functionality.\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Adobe Spectrum Design System](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/text-field/)\n- [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/TextField.html)\n- [W3C ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)\n",
