Highlight the current date and any selected dates.\n- **Intuitive navigation:** Provide clear controls to move between different\n  time periods (days, weeks, months, years).\n- **Easy date range selection:** For applications requiring date ranges, provide\n  an intuitive way to select start and end dates, often with visual\n  highlighting.\n- **Clear labels and instructions:** Provide clear labels for navigation\n  controls and any interactive elements within the calendar.\n\n### Usage\n\nA calendar is used to visually display and manage time-based information,\nallowing users to view, schedule, and interact with dates. A common way this\ncomponent is used is within the popover, and paired with the date input.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> When to use\n\n- **Scheduling:** When users need to select specific dates.\n- **Visualizing time-based data:** To display data or to filter data in a\n  corresponding visual.\n- **Date range selection:** When users need to select a start and end date for a\n  period.\n- **Browsing dates:** When users need to navigate through different days, weeks,\n  or months to find a specific date.\n- **Contextual awareness of dates:** When the day of the week or the\n  relationship between dates is important for decision-making.\n- **Recurring events:** To allow users to set up and manage events that repeat\n  on a regular basis.\n\n### Keeping interactions simple\n\nSimple calendar interactions are vital because they minimize user effort and\ncognitive load, allowing for quick and efficient time management, the calendar's\nprimary function.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> **Do**\n>\n> - Provide clear navigation. Make it easy to move between days, weeks, months,\n>   and years using intuitive controls (arrows, drop downs).\n> - Enable easy date range selection. If your application requires date ranges,\n>   make the selection process straightforward (e.g., click start, click end).\n> - Consider time zones (if applicable). If your application deals with users in\n>   different time zones, handle and display times accordingly.\n> - Ensure navigation controls are clearly labeled and their function is\n>   obvious.\n\n![interaction - do's](/images/range-calendar/interaction-do.png)\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> **Don't**\n>\n> - Don't over clutter. Avoid displaying too much information on the calendar\n>   grid at once, which can make it overwhelming.\n> - Don't make navigation confusing. Ensure navigation controls are clearly\n>   labeled and their function is obvious.\n> - Don't use it for simple date input. If users know the exact date, a direct\n>   date input field might be more efficient.\n> - Don't auto-submit on date selection.
