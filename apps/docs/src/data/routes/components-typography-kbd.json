Do not use it for general UI elements (like buttons or links).\n- **Maintain conciseness:** Keep the content inside the KBD component short—usually one or two words, or a symbol—to represent the specific key (e.g., Enter, Shift, Ctrl).\n- **Combinations:** Clearly indicate key combinations using a simple, recognized separator (e.g., + or a hyphen) within the KBD component (e.g., Ctrl + S).\n- **Visual consistency:** Ensure the KBD component's border, background color, and font style make it visually distinct from the surrounding text while remaining integrated with the overall design.\n- **Appropriate sizing:** The size of the KBD text and box should be proportional to the surrounding body text to avoid unnecessary visual distraction.\n\n### Usage\n\nThis component is an additional way to convey information in a non interactive way. Use in moderation, using too often can make text unreadable.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> When to use\n- Displaying keyboard shortcuts in help text or tooltips\n- Representing individual keys in user interfaces\n- Highlighting keyboard navigation instructions\n- To display command line input or terminal code within technical instructions.\n- To clearly show keyboard shortcuts in application documentation or tooltips (e.g., \"Press Ctrl + Z to undo\").\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> When not to use\n- Don't allow the component to wrap excessively; keep the contained text short.\n- Don't use KBD for displaying long code snippets (use a `<code>` block instead).\n- Don't use KBD without accompanying explanatory text to provide context.\n\n### Properties\n\n<PropsTable id=\"Kbd\" />\n\n### Accessibility\n\nAccessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => <div>Press <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd> to copy</div>\n```\n\n### Accessibility Standards\n\n- **Semantic Meaning:** The `<kbd>` element provides clear semantic meaning to screen readers, indicating that the enclosed text represents keyboard input.\n- **Reading Flow:** Ensure the KBD component doesn't interrupt the natural reading flow of the surrounding sentence.\n- **Contrast:** The key's background color and the text color must adhere to WCAG contrast guidelines for legibility.\n- **Focus (N/A):** Note that the KBD component itself is generally non-interactive and therefore should not be focusable via the keyboard.\n",
