A toggle button or icon toggle button gives a user a new way of\nvisualizing the information in the interface. It does not typically perform an\naction. Please use a button or an icon button for these uses.\n\n### Resources\n\nDeep dive into implementation details and access the Nimbus design library.\n\n[Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/AvtPX6g7OGGCRvNlatGOIY/NIMBUS-design-system?node-id=5921-47629&m=dev)\n\n## Variables\n\nGet familiar with the features.\n\n### Visuals\n\n#### Outlined\n\nMost common styling of the icon toggle button.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <IconToggleButton variant=\"outline\" aria-label=\"Pin item\">\n    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n  </IconToggleButton>\n)\n```\n\n#### Ghost\n\nGhost styled buttons are helpful for UI simplification.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <IconToggleButton variant=\"ghost\" aria-label=\"Pin item\">\n    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n  </IconToggleButton>\n)\n```\n\n### Size\n\nThere are three sizes to icon toggle buttons, the default size is medium (md),\nextra small (xs), and 2x-small (2xs).\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <Stack direction=\"row\" gap=\"400\">\n    <IconToggleButton size=\"md\" aria-label=\"Pin favorite\">\n      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n    </IconToggleButton>\n    <IconToggleButton size=\"xs\" aria-label=\"Pin favorite\">\n      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n    </IconToggleButton>\n    <IconToggleButton size=\"2xs\" aria-label=\"Pin favorite\">\n      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n    </IconToggleButton>\n  </Stack>\n)\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\nIcon toggle button guidelines aim to provide clear and consistent visual\nfeedback to users for compact binary states.\n\n### Best practices\n\n- **Avoid setting a default toggle as active:** Instead, let users choose their\n  preference. If one option is selected more frequently, make it the default,\n  while still allowing users to switch to the less popular choice.\n- **Intuitive icons:** Use icons that are universally recognized for the action\n  they represent. Consider adding a tooltip on hover to provide a text label to\n  help a user understand what is being chosen.\n- **Maintain visual consistency:** The icon's style (line weight, color, fill)\n  should be consistent with the rest of the icons in the design system to ensure\n  a cohesive look and feel.\n- **Provide immediate feedback:** The button should visually respond instantly\n  when a user clicks or taps it, providing reassurance that the action was\n  successful.\n- **Communicate meaningful changes:** If a toggle button makes a significant\n  change (ex: updating default payment) pair this toggled action with a toast\n  message to better communicate the change when needed.\n\n##### Toggle Groups (Segmented Controls)\n\n- **Enforce mutual exclusivity:** Use toggle groups (segmented controls) when\n  the user must select only one option from a small, defined set, similar to\n  radio button behavior (e.g., alignment controls, viewing modes).\n- **Limit options:** Keep the number of options within a group small (ideally 3\n  to 5) to prevent overcrowding and ensure each button is easily tappable.\n\n### Usage\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> When to use\n\n- **Compact binary states:** Use them for on/off settings in toolbars or\n  space-limited areas (e.g., toggling bold text, muting).\n- **Clear, universal actions:** Use them for actions whose icon is immediately\n  understood without a text label (e.g., Pin, Star).\n- **Quick filtering:** Use them for providing quick, visual controls for\n  filtering items or selecting a mode.\n- **Frequent interactions:** Use them when an action is performed often to save\n  time and screen space.\n- **Instant application:** When the action takes effect immediately without\n  requiring the user to press a separate \"Save\" or \"Submit\" button.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> When not to use\n\n- **Ambiguous actions:** Do not use them when the icon's meaning is unclear or\n  requires the user to guess; use a text label or tooltip.\n- **Complex or multi-state processes:** Avoid using them for actions that\n  require more than two states or sequential steps; use a segmented button or\n  switch.\n- **Critical, permanent actions:** Do not use them for destructive or major\n  actions; use a full text button with confirmation.\n- **Core navigation:** Avoid making primary navigation items toggle-able unless\n  they explicitly switch between two main views.\n- **Multi-select options:** If the user can select multiple items from a list,\n  use checkboxes instead.\n- **Multi-state options:** If the user needs to select one option from three or\n  more choices, use radio buttons or a segmented control instead.\n- **Actions requiring confirmation:** Do not use for actions that are\n  destructive, irreversible, or require confirmation (e.g., deleting an account,\n  submitting a payment). Use a standard button that triggers a confirmation\n  dialog.\n- **Complex settings:** Avoid using a toggle if the result of the action isn't\n  clear or if the setting requires additional input fields to be configured.\n- **Triggers for new pages:** Do not use a toggle to navigate to a new section\n  or page; use a link or standard button for navigation.\n- **Long-running processes:** For actions that take time to complete (e.g.,\n  \"Start Backup\"), a standard button that displays a loading spinner upon press\n  is more appropriate.\n\n### Icon toggle buttons in use\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> **Do**\n>\n> - Do use icon toggle buttons for a simple binary choice (on/off).\n> - Do place them in toolbars or areas where space is limited.\n> - Do ensure the \"on\" state is clearly distinct from the \"off\" state.\n> - Do connect buttons that toggle one active state among a small selection of\n>   options.\n\n![Do](/images/icon-toggle-button/icon-toggle-button-do.png)\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> **Don't**\n>\n> - Don't use them for multi-step processes or complex selections.\n> - Don't use an ambiguous icon without a tooltip or a text label.\n> - Don't use an icon toggle button, when you should use an icon button instead.\n\n![Don't](/images/icon-toggle-button/icon-toggle-button-dont.png)\n\n## Specs\n\n<PropsTable id=\"IconToggleButton\" />\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAccessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by\neveryone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,\ncognitive, and physical limitations.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <IconToggleButton aria-label=\"Toggle favorite\">\n    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n  </IconToggleButton>\n)\n```\n\n### Accessibility standards\n\n- **Use aria-pressed:** The most crucial accessibility attribute for a icon\n  toggle button is `aria-pressed`. When the button is \"on,\" set\n  `aria-pressed=\"true\"`. When it's \"off,\" set `aria-pressed=\"false\"`. This tells\n  screen readers that the button's function is to toggle.\n- **Provide a Clear aria-label:** Since the button lacks visible text, provide a\n  descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., `aria-label=\"Toggle Bold\"` or\n  `aria-label=\"Show Advanced Settings\"`). This is what a screen reader will\n  announce to the user.\n- **Ensure Keyboard Operability:** Users must be able to navigate to the button\n  using the Tab key and toggle its state using the Enter or Spacebar keys.\n",
