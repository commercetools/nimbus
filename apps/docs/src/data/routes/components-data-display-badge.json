They feature concise text and customizable styling for clear communication without overwhelming the primary content.\n\n### Resources\n\nDeep dive into implementation details and access the Nimbus design library.\n\n[Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/AvtPX6g7OGGCRvNlatGOIY/NIMBUS-design-system?node-id=2656-4636&m=dev)\n\n## Variables\n\nGet familiar with the features.\n\n### Size\n\n#### Medium\nThis is the default size.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <Badge colorPalette=\"primary\" size=\"md\">\n    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n    Badge\n    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n  </Badge>\n)\n```\n\n#### X-small\nFor uses where several badges will be shown at one time.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <Badge colorPalette=\"primary\" size=\"xs\">\n    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n    Badge\n    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n  </Badge>\n)\n```\n\n#### 2X-small\nUse these when there are a more than a few badges at one time, or to be less distracting to let the user focus on other parts of the surrounding page.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <Badge colorPalette=\"primary\" size=\"2xs\">\n    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n    Badge\n    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />\n  </Badge>\n)\n```\n\n### Visual options\n\nBadges can be set to use either the semantic color palette or any other radix color. When pairing new radix colors, the formula uses the 3rd color shade for the background and the 11th for text to maintain text accessibility.\n\n#### Semantic colors\nWhen a badge is supposed to convey a specific and consistent meaning, use these predefined color options.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => {\n  const semanticColors = ['info', 'primary', 'positive', 'critical', 'warning', 'neutral'];\n  \n  return (\n    <Stack direction=\"horizontal\" gap=\"400\" alignItems=\"center\" flexWrap=\"wrap\">\n      {semanticColors.map(color => (\n        <Badge key={color} colorPalette={color}>{color}</Badge>\n      ))}\n    </Stack>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Custom colors\nWhen the color of the badge serves a purely aesthetic purpose, or the semantic color palette does not offer enough options, use any of these available options from our color palette.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => {\n  const customColors = ['teal', 'pink', 'mint'];\n  \n  return (\n    <Stack direction=\"horizontal\" gap=\"400\" alignItems=\"center\" flexWrap=\"wrap\">\n      {customColors.map(color => (\n        <Badge key={color} colorPalette={color}>{color}</Badge>\n      ))}\n    </Stack>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\nBadge guidelines ensure small, clear visual cues that highlight status or metadata without overwhelming UI.\n\n### Best practices\n\n- **Be concise**: Keep badge labels short and to the point (ideally 1-2 words or a small number).\n- **Use purposefully**: Only use badges to highlight truly important information or status; avoid overusing them.\n- **Maintain visual hierarchy**: Ensure badges are visually less prominent than the elements they annotate.\n- **Employ semantic colors**: Use established color palettes to consistently indicate meaning (e.g., green for success, red for error).\n- **Place strategically**: Position badges consistently in relation to their associated elements for easy recognition.\n- **Provide context**: If an icon-only badge is used, ensure a tooltip or surrounding context clarifies its meaning.\n\n### Usage\n\nBadges are small labels that highlight relevant metadata without overwhelming the primary content, often using color and short text or icons to quickly convey meaning. They are commonly found attached to navigation items, buttons, lists, and avatars to draw attention to updates, counts, or specific attributes.\n\n#### Should I use badges or tags?\n\n- **Tags** display items of the same category, or basically a list of things just styled more aesthetically (e.g., countries). An item can display more than one tag at once as a group.\n- **Badges** highlight the differences between the listed items (e.g., status: Published, Modified, Rejected) and benefit from semantic color ways to convey process or status. An item should only show one badge; if you want to show more than one, use a tag instead.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> When to use\n- **Use for concise information:** Keep badge text short (1-2 words) for quick readability.\n- **Indicate status or category:** Clearly signal the state or classification of an associated element.\n- **Maintain visual hierarchy:** Ensure badges are visually subordinate to the elements they modify.\n- **Use color thoughtfully:** Employ color consistently to convey meaning (e.g., green for positive, red for negative).\n- **Ensure accessibility:** Provide sufficient color contrast meeting at least AA requirements, and use ARIA attributes for screen readers.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> When not to use\n- **Don't overuse badges:** Reserve them for important highlights to avoid visual clutter.\n- **Don't use as headers:** Employ proper typography for establishing hierarchy.\n- **Don't use for lengthy feedback:** Use other UI elements for detailed messages.\n- **Don't rely solely on color:** Supplement color with text or icons for accessibility.\n- **Don't place them obstructively:** Ensure badges don't cover or interfere with primary content or interactions.\n\n### Semantic colors\n\nUse the established color palettes to consistently indicate meaning (if applicable) when using badges.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> **Do**\n>\n> - When communicating a success or positive state, use grass (green). For a negative or critical state use tomato (red). If you need a warning state, use yellow (amber). For default or neutral color options, use grey (slate), blue, or purple (primary). \n\n![](/images/badge/badge-semantic-colors-do.png)\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> **Don't**\n>\n> - Don't trick your users when the common pattern will be to have the meaning and color together.\n> - Do not use icons without label unless used with a tooltip label so users can best understand the meaning of the badge.\n> - Don't rely solely on color to relate a state. Pairing colors with an icon and short descriptive label will be the best experience for accessibility standards.\n\n![](/images/badge/badge-semantic-colors-dont.png)\n\n### Purposeful uses\n\nTaking care not to overuse badges is important, they are great tools to help users group or understand statuses, but overuse can be confusing and overwhelming.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> **Do**\n>\n> - Do use short and concise labels for badges, making sure not to overuse and clutter the space for the user.\n> - If using icons, pair the icon with a label or a tooltip so the user can understand the meaning.\n\n![](/images/badge/badge-uses-do.png)\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> **Don't**\n>\n> - Do not overuse badges.\n> - Do not be overly descriptive with labels. Keep language as short as possible. \n\n![](/images/badge/badge-uses-dont.png)\n\n## Properties\n\n<PropsTable id=\"Badge\" />\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAccessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <Badge \n    data-testid=\"status-badge\" \n    aria-label=\"Status: Active\"\n    colorPalette=\"primary\"\n  >\n    <Icons.StarOutline />\n    I am a badge\n  </Badge>\n)\n```\n\n### Accessibility standards\n\n- Always provide a meaningful label. If a visible label is not used, provide an aria-label for screen readers.\n- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all elements (text and background).\n- Avoid relying on color alone to convey information.\n- Clearly indicate keyboard focus when interactive.\n- Support keyboard navigation (e.g., `Tab`, `Space`, `Enter`).\n- Manage text overflow (wrap text or truncate with a tooltip).\n- Use descriptive `aria-describedby` if attached to an interactive element.\n- Include a tooltip for icon-only badges.\n\n#### Resources\n\n- [Adobe Spectrum Design System](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/badge/)\n- [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useBadge.html)\n- [W3C ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/badge/) (Search for \"Badge\" patterns or general guidance on status indicators)\n",
