The component automatically formats the input as the user types.\n\n### Resources\n\nDeep dive into implementation details and access the Nimbus design library.\n\n[Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/design/AvtPX6g7OGGCRvNlatGOIY?node-id=5818-15933#1436729216)\n[Storybook Link](https://nimbus-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/docs/components-date-dateinput--docs)\n\n\n## Variables\n\nGet familiar with the features.\n\n### Visual options\n**Medium**\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => <DateInput aria-label=\"Enter a date\"/>\n```\n\n**Small**\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => <DateInput size=\"sm\" aria-label=\"Enter a date\"/>\n```\n\n## Guidelines\nDate input guidelines establish a standardized approach for creating intuitive and accessible date input components, ensuring consistency in presentation and interaction for selecting dates across all applications.\n\n### Best practices\n\n- **Use a clear placeholder.** Provide a placeholder in a conventional date format to guide the user (e.g., mm/dd/yyyy).\n- **Provide clear validation.** Offer clear, concise error messages for incorrect or invalid input.\n- **Format automatically.** Format the date as the user types to reduce errors and improve usability.\n- **Use for specific dates.** Use this component when a user needs to enter a known date. Avoid using it for date ranges or when a calendar view would be more beneficial.\n- **Ensure accessibility.** The input field will have a clear accessible label and be compatible with screen readers.\n\n### Usage\nA date input component allows users to enter a specific date. The component provides a single input field for manual entry. Use this component when a calendar selection is unnecessary or when a user is likely to know the specific date they need to enter.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> When to use\n\n- **Entering a known date.** Use when the user knows the specific date, such as a birth date, an expiration date, or a past event.\n- **A calendar is not necessary.** Use when a calendar popover would be an unnecessary step for the user, simplifying the user experience.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> When not to use\n\n- **Selecting a date range.** Do not use a single date input to select a start and end date. Use a date range picker instead.\n- **Choosing an unknown date.** Avoid using this component when the user needs to browse or select a date they don't already know, such as setting a date for promotion or setting a range for expecting for a shipment. In these cases, a calendar popover is more effective.\n\n### Basic interactions\n\nClear labels and concise messaging are crucial for a date input to ensure users understand what date information is required and how to provide it correctly.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> **Do**\n>\n> - Do provide a clear placeholder in a conventional date format.\n> - Do automatically format the date as the user types.\n> - Do provide validation and clear error messages.\n> - Do use this component when a user needs to enter a known, specific date.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <FormField.Root>\n    <FormField.Label>Birth Date</FormField.Label>\n    <FormField.Input>\n      <DateInput aria-label=\"Birth date\" />\n    </FormField.Input>\n  </FormField.Root>\n);\n```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> **Don't**\n> - Don't use a generic placeholder like \"enter date.\"\n> - Don't require the user to manually enter separators like \"/\" or \"-\".\n> - Don't allow invalid dates to be submitted without feedback.\n> - Don't use this component when a calendar selection would be more helpful or when selecting a date range.\n\n![](/images/date-input/date-input-dont.png)\n\n\n### Properties\n\n<PropsTable id=\"DateInput\"/>\n\n### Accessibility\n\nAccessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <DateInput aria-label=\"Enter a date\" />\n);\n```\n\n### Accessibility standards\n- Ensure the input field has a clear, descriptive label that is programmatically associated with the input element.\n- The component should be fully operable using a keyboard. \n- The focus order must be logical and predictable.\n- The component should be compatible with screen readers, announcing its purpose, state, and any validation errors.\n- Error messages should be clearly linked to the input field they refer to and be announced by screen readers.\n- Maintain sufficient color contrast for text and other visual elements to ensure readability.\n- The input field and any interactive elements should have large enough touch targets for mobile users.\n- The date format should align with the user's regional settings and be easily understandable.\n- Use appropriate autocomplete attributes, such as birthday, to assist users and improve form-filling.\n",
