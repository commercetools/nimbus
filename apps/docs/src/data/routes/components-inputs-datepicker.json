There are two offered sizes, the default being medium for\nmost use cases.\n\n### Resources\n\nDeep dive into implementation details and access the Nimbus design library.\n\n[Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/AvtPX6g7OGGCRvNlatGOIY/NIMBUS-design-system?node-id=2923-4379&m=dev)\n\n## Variables\n\nGet familiar with the features.\n\n### Visual options\n\n#### Medium\n\n```jsx-live\n const App = () => <DatePicker size=\"md\" aria-label=\"Enter a date\" width=\"1/3\" />\n```\n\n#### Small\n\n```jsx-live\n const App = () => <DatePicker size=\"sm\" aria-label=\"Enter a date\" width=\"1/3\" />\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\nDate picker guidelines establish a standardized approach for creating intuitive\nand accessible date input components, ensuring consistency in presentation and\ninteraction for selecting dates across all applications.\n\n### Best practices\n\n- **Clear labeling:** Use explicit and descriptive labels that clearly indicate\n  what date information is needed (e.g., \"Date of Birth,\" \"Event Date\").\n- **Provide format hints:** Clearly display the expected date format (e.g.,\n  MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD) using placeholder text or helper text.\n- **Offer multiple input methods:** Allow users to both manually type in the\n  date and select it from a visual calendar picker.\n- **Use input masks:** Consider using input masks to guide formatting as the\n  user types, but ensure they don't hinder accessibility or flexibility.\n- **Validate input:** Provide real-time validation and clear error messages for\n  incorrect date formats or invalid dates.\n- **Show current date:** In a calendar picker, clearly highlight the current\n  date for easy reference.\n- **Enable easy navigation:** Make it simple to navigate months and years within\n  the calendar picker (e.g., using forward/backward buttons and year dropdown).\n- **Indicate selected date:** Clearly visually distinguish the selected date in\n  the calendar.\n- **Handle unavailable dates:** If certain dates are unavailable (e.g., past\n  dates for future events), clearly indicate them as disabled.\n- **Ensure keyboard accessibility:** Make all parts of the DatePicker (input,\n  calendar) navigable and operable using the keyboard.\n- **Provide sufficient contrast:** Ensure adequate color contrast between text,\n  icons, and background elements for accessibility.\n- **Localization:** Adapt the date format and calendar display to the user's\n  locale.\n- **Offer preset ranges:** For date range selections, provide common presets\n  like \"Last week,\" \"This month,\" etc.\n\n### Usage\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> When to use\n\n- **Specific date selection required:** When users need to choose a particular\n  date, such as a birthdate, appointment date, or event date.\n- **Date-related tasks:** For features involving scheduling, filtering by date,\n  setting deadlines, or defining date ranges.\n- **Standardized input format:** To ensure users enter dates in a consistent and\n  predictable format, reducing data entry errors.\n- **Visual calendar navigation:** When users benefit from a visual\n  representation of a calendar to navigate and select dates, especially for date\n  ranges or when the day of the week is relevant.\n- **Accessibility needs:** To provide an accessible alternative to manual text\n  input for users with disabilities, including keyboard navigation and screen\n  reader support.\n- **Clear date context:** When the date is a primary piece of information and\n  needs to be explicitly chosen.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> When not to use\n\n- **Approximate or vague dates:** When the exact date is not critical, and users\n  might only know a month or year (consider a select dropdown or a less specific\n  input).\n- **Dates far in the past or future:** For dates like birth dates, consider a\n  direct text input with clear formatting hints or segmented inputs\n  (month/day/year) to avoid excessive calendar navigation. However, a date\n  picker can still be suitable if well-implemented with year selection.\n- **Simple \"today\" or \"now\" selection:** For actions that simply require the\n  current date or time, a button or automated function might be more efficient.\n- **Limited screen real estate:** On very constrained interfaces, a compact text\n  input with a clear format might be preferred over an expanded calendar, though\n  accessibility should still be a priority.\n- **High frequency of typing known dates:** If users frequently know the exact\n  date they need to enter and typing is faster for them, a well-formatted text\n  input with validation might be sufficient alongside (or instead of) a date\n  picker. (e.g. birthdays)\n- **Binary \"yes/no\" for date-related options:** For simple choices like \"Remind\n  me?\" (implying the current date/time), a checkbox or switch might be more\n  appropriate.\n\n### Labels and messaging\n\nClear labels and concise messaging are crucial for a date input to ensure users\nunderstand what date information is required and how to provide it correctly.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> **Do**\n>\n> - Do use a clear and descriptive label (e.g., \"Date of Birth,\" \"Event Date\").\n> - Do provide clear formatting hints (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY) as placeholder text or\n>   helper text.\n> - Do validate the input and provide clear error messages for incorrect formats\n>   or invalid dates.\n\n![labels and messaging - do's](/images/date-picker/labels-and-messaging-do.png)\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> **Don't**\n>\n> - Don't rely solely on placeholder text for the label.\n> - Don't use ambiguous date formats without clear guidance.\n> - Don't fail to provide feedback on invalid input.\n\n![labels and messaging - don'ts](/images/date-picker/labels-and-messaging-dont.png)\n\n### Interaction and selection\n\nThe ideal date picker interaction offers a seamless experience through intuitive\ncalendar navigation, clear visual feedback on selection, and the flexibility of\nboth direct typing and visual selection to accommodate user preferences and\naccessibility needs.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> **Do**\n>\n> - Do highlight the current date in the calendar picker for reference.\n> - Do provide a visual calendar picker for easy selection, especially for\n>   non-familiar dates or date ranges.\n> - Do allow manual text input as an alternative for users who prefer it or know\n>   the date.\n> - Do clearly indicate the selected date(s) in the calendar.\n> - Do enable easy navigation between months and years in the calendar.\n> - Do consider providing preset date ranges (e.g., \"Last Week,\" \"Next Month\")\n>   when relevant.\n\n![interaction and selection - do's](/images/date-picker/interaction-and-selection-do.png)\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> **Don't**\n>\n> - Don't use it for selecting vague or non-specific timeframes (e.g., \"sometime\n>   next year\").\n> - Don't force users to only use the calendar picker if they prefer typing.\n> - Don't use it for simple \"today\" selections where a button might suffice.\n> - Don't auto-advance between date segments (day/month/year) in text input, as\n>   it can hinder error correction.\n> - Don't make calendar navigation cumbersome.\n\n![interaction and selection - don'ts](/images/date-picker/interaction-and-selection-dont.png)\n\n## Specs\n\n<PropsTable id=\"DatePicker\" />\n\n### Accessibility\n\nAccessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by\neveryone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,\ncognitive, and physical limitations.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => <DatePicker aria-label=\"Enter a date\" />\n```\n\n### Accessibility standards\n\n- Always provide a visible label for the input.\n- Clearly associate the label with the input using the for attribute on the\n  `<label>` and a matching id on the input element.\n- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all elements (text, borders, icons, focus\n  indicators).\n- Clearly indicate the focused state.\n- Support keyboard navigation:\n  - Use Tab to navigate to and from the date input.\n  - Use Enter or Space to open/close the date picker (if applicable).\n  - Use arrow keys to navigate within the calendar grid (if a date picker is\n    provided).\n  - Allow users to select dates using Enter or Space.\n- Communicate errors clearly, using both visual cues (e.g., color) and\n  descriptive error messages.\n- Provide clear instructions on the expected date format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY).\n- Ensure screen readers announce the selected date and any navigation changes\n  within a date picker.\n- Provide an accessible way to clear the date input.\n\n#### Resources\n\n- [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/DatePicker.html)\n- [W3C ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/)\n",
