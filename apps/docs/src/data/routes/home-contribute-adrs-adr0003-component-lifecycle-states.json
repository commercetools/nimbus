Without a standardized\nlifecycle system, consumers cannot make informed decisions about adoption,\nmigration planning, or production readiness.\n\nThe lack of clear lifecycle states leads to:\n- Uncertainty about which features are safe for production use\n- Difficulty planning migrations when APIs change\n- Inconsistent expectations about support and maintenance\n- Confusion about the maturity level of different library elements\n\nWe need a structured approach that balances innovation (allowing for\nexperimentation and iteration) with stability (providing reliable,\nproduction-ready features).\n\n## Decision\n\nWe will implement a six-stage lifecycle system for all UI library elements,\ndivided into Pre-Release States and General Availability States. Each state\nclearly communicates stability expectations, support commitments, and\ntransition pathways.\n\n### Pre-Release States\n\nThese states are for features under active development, subject to rapid\nchange, and not yet recommended for general production use.\n\n#### 1. Experimental\n- **Purpose**: Earliest public state for new concepts, significant API\n  redesigns, or exploratory features\n- **Stability**: Highly unstable, may be removed entirely without notice\n- **Goal**: Validate ideas and gather initial conceptual feedback\n- **Consumer Usage**: Absolutely not for production use; only for deep\n  exploration and early-stage feedback\n- **Breaking Changes**: Highest frequency, no advance warning\n- **Transitions**: To Alpha (if viable) or Deprecated (if not viable)\n- **Marking**: Clearly marked as `(Experimental)` in documentation,\n  changelogs, and `@experimental` JSDoc tag\n\n#### 2. Alpha\n- **Purpose**: Features with clearer direction that have passed experimental\n  validation\n- **Stability**: Still highly unstable with known bugs and incomplete\n  functionality\n- **Goal**: Early adopter testing and initial feedback on core concepts\n- **Consumer Usage**: Not for production use; exploration and feedback only\n- **Breaking Changes**: Frequent breaking changes without warning\n- **Transitions**: To Beta (if successful) or Deprecated (if not viable)\n- **Marking**: Clearly marked as `(Alpha)` in documentation, changelogs, and\n  `@alpha` JSDoc tag\n\n#### 3. Beta\n- **Purpose**: More stable features with mostly complete core functionality\n- **Stability**: Subject to breaking changes but less frequently than Alpha\n- **Goal**: Gather broad feedback on functionality and usability\n- **Consumer Usage**: Use with caution in non-critical production\n  environments\n- **Breaking Changes**: Some breaking changes, typically with prior notice,\n  may occur in minor versions\n- **Transitions**: To Stable (if successful) or Deprecated (if not viable)\n- **Marking**: Clearly marked as `(Beta)` in documentation, changelogs, and\n  `@beta` JSDoc tag\n\n### General Availability States\n\nThese states represent stable and supported features, and features being\nphased out.\n\n#### 4. Stable\n- **Purpose**: Standard, production-ready state\n- **Stability**: API considered stable, thoroughly tested, and actively\n  maintained\n- **Goal**: Provide reliable, consistent functionality for production\n  applications\n- **Consumer Usage**: Recommended for all production applications\n- **Breaking Changes**: Adhere to strict semantic versioning (only in major\n  releases) with clear migration guides\n- **Transitions**: To Deprecated (when superseded or no longer relevant)\n- **Marking**: Default status requiring no special marking; documentation\n  confirms stability\n\n#### 5. Deprecated\n- **Purpose**: Not to be used in new development. Superseded by better\n  alternatives or found not viable as an Alpha or Beta\n- **Stability**: Maintained for compatibility but no new features\n- **Goal**: Provide transition period for migration to alternatives\n- **Consumer Usage**: Avoid for new development; migrate existing usage to\n  recommended alternatives\n- **Breaking Changes**: Only critical bug fixes; no new features\n- **Transitions**: To End-of-Life (EOL)\n- **Marking**: Clear warnings in documentation with recommended alternatives;\n  `@deprecated` JSDoc tag; console warnings during development; date for \n  the EOL transition\n\n#### 6. End-of-Life (EOL)\n- **Purpose**: Complete removal from the library\n- **Stability**: No longer available\n- **Goal**: Clean up deprecated features\n- **Consumer Usage**: Element is gone; applications using it will break upon\n  upgrade\n- **Breaking Changes**: N/A (element removed)\n- **Transitions**: N/A (terminal state)\n- **Marking**: Not present in current documentation or code; removal noted in\n  release notes\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- **Clear Communication**: Consumers can make informed decisions about\n  feature adoption based on explicit stability guarantees\n- **Predictable Migration Path**: Well-defined transition states help\n  consumers plan upgrades and migrations\n- **Innovation Support**: Pre-release states allow for experimentation while\n  protecting production users\n- **Maintenance Clarity**: Clear support commitments for each state help\n  prioritize development resources\n- **Semantic Versioning Alignment**: Lifecycle states work with semantic\n  versioning to provide comprehensive change communication\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- **Additional Overhead**: Requires consistent marking and tracking of\n  lifecycle states across all library elements\n- **Documentation Complexity**: More detailed documentation needed to explain\n  states and transitions\n- **Consumer Learning Curve**: Users must understand the lifecycle system to\n  make appropriate adoption decisions\n- **Potential Confusion**: Multiple pre-release states might create\n  uncertainty about which features to try\n\n### Implementation Requirements\n\n- **Documentation Standards**: All elements must be clearly marked with their\n  lifecycle state\n- **Tooling Integration**: JSDoc tags, TypeScript definitions, and build\n  tools should reflect lifecycle states\n- **Communication Process**: Clear guidelines for announcing state\n  transitions in changelogs and release notes\n- **Development Workflow**: Integration with development processes to ensure\n  proper state management\n\n## Examples\n\n### Experimental Feature\n```jsx\n/**\n * @experimental This component is experimental and may be removed without\n * notice\n */\nexport const ExperimentalDataGrid = () => {\n  // Implementation\n};\n```\n\n### Beta Feature with Migration Path\n```jsx\n/**\n * @beta This component is in beta. API may change in minor versions.\n * Expected to reach stable in v2.1.0\n */\nexport const BetaAdvancedSelect = () => {\n  // Implementation\n};\n```\n\n### Deprecated Feature\n```jsx\n/**\n * @deprecated Use `NewButton` instead. Will be removed in v3.0.0\n * @see {@link NewButton}\n */\nexport const OldButton = () => {\n  console.warn('OldButton is deprecated. Use NewButton instead.');\n  // Implementation\n};\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThe six-stage lifecycle system provides clear communication about feature\nstability and support commitments. Pre-release states (Experimental, Alpha,\nBeta) enable innovation while protecting production users, while General\nAvailability states (Stable, Deprecated, EOL) ensure reliable long-term\nsupport and predictable migration paths.\n\nThis system balances the need for innovation with stability requirements,\ngiving consumers the information they need to make appropriate adoption\ndecisions while providing clear guidelines for library maintainers.
