Easily toggle between month, year, and single\nday selection.\n\n### Resources\n\nDeep dive into implementation details and access the Nimbus design library.\n\n[Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/AvtPX6g7OGGCRvNlatGOIY/NIMBUS-design-system?m=auto&node-id=5818-15651)\n[Storybook](https://nimbus-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/docs/components-date-calendar--docs)\n\n## Variables\n\nGet familiar with the features.\n\n### Visual options\n\n**Single date select**\n\nAllow users to see the current date, and select a single date.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => <Calendar aria-label=\"Enter a date\" />\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\nCalendar guidelines focus on creating intuitive and accessible interfaces for\nviewing, navigating, and interacting with dates and events.\n\n### Best practices\n\n- **Clear visual hierarchy:** Distinguished between days, weeks, months, and\n  years. Highlight the current date and any selected dates.\n- **Intuitive navigation:** Clear controls to move between different time\n  periods (days, weeks, months, years).\n- **Clear labels and instructions:** Clear labels for navigation controls and\n  any interactive elements within the calendar.\n\n### Usage\n\nA calendar is used to visually display and manage time-based information,\nallowing users to view, schedule, and interact with dates. A common way this\ncomponent is used is within the popover, and paired with the date input.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> When to use\n\n- **Scheduling:** When users need to select specific dates and times.\n- **Visualizing time-based data:** To display data or to filter data in a\n  corresponding visual.\n- **Browsing dates:** When users need to navigate through different days, weeks,\n  or months to find a specific date or time.\n- **Contextual awareness of dates:** When the day of the week or the\n  relationship between dates is important for decision-making.\n- **Recurring events:** To allow users to set up and manage events that repeat\n  on a regular basis.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> When not to use\n\n- **Simple date input:** If users already know the specific date (e.g., date of\n  birth) and typing it in a formatted field is quicker and easier.\n- **Selecting a single \"today\" or \"now\":** For actions that inherently refer to\n  the current date and time, a button or automatic function is more efficient.\n- **Limited screen space:** On very small interfaces, a compact date input or a\n  simplified selection method might be necessary.\n- **Linear processes:** For step-by-step workflows where date selection is just\n  one field, a calendar might be an unnecessary interruption.\n- **Non-time-related data:** For displaying or managing information that isn't\n  tied to specific dates or times.\n\n#### Keeping interactions simple\n\nSimple calendar interactions are vital because they minimize user effort and\ncognitive load, allowing for quick and efficient time management, the calendar's\nprimary function.\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> **Do**\n>\n> - Provide clear navigation.

Avoid displaying too much information on the calendar\n>   grid at once, which can make it overwhelming.\n> - Don't make navigation confusing. Ensure navigation controls are clearly\n>   labeled and their function is obvious.\n> - Don't use it for simple date input. If users know the exact date, a direct\n>   date input field might be more efficient.\n> - Don't auto-submit on date selection.
