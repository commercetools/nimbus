They govern image quality, responsive behavior, appropriate usage of formats, and adherence to critical accessibility standards like meaningful alt text.\n\n### Best practices\n\n- **Relevance:** Ensure the image directly supports or enhances the content it is paired with; avoid purely decorative or confusing visuals.\n- **Quality and format:** Use high-quality, appropriately sized images.\n  - **JPEG/WebP:** For photographs and complex images.\n  - **PNG:** For images requiring transparency or simple graphics.\n  - **SVG:** For logos, icons, and illustrations that need crisp scaling.\n- **Responsiveness:** Implement responsive design principles so images scale correctly and maintain aspect ratios across various screen sizes without distorting or breaking the layout.\n- **Performance optimization:** Compress images to minimize file size and ensure fast loading times. Implement lazy loading for images that appear below the fold.\n- **Visual hierarchy:** Images should contribute to, but not dominate, the visual hierarchy unless they are the primary content (e.g., product hero image).\n- **Maintain brand style:** Ensure all illustrations and graphics adhere to the established brand style and color palette.\n\n## Specs\n\n<PropsTable id=\"Image\" />\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAccessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.\n\n```jsx-live\nconst App = () => (\n  <Image\n    src=\"/images/image/image-sample.png\"\n    alt=\"luxury metallic green handbag with floral handle. Mangosteen accessory hangs off the bag, and sitting on the table with the bag are small accessories, a pen, lipstick, and small notebook.\"\n    width=\"4000\"\n  />\n)\n```\n\n### Accessibility Standards\n\n- **Alt text is mandatory:** Every image must have an `alt` attribute. If the image is decorative, use a null/empty attribute (`alt=\"\"`). If it conveys meaning, the alt text must be descriptive and functional.\n- **Complex images:** For charts, graphs, or infographics, the text alternative must go beyond the title to describe the key information conveyed by the image.\n- **Performance:** Optimize images to ensure they load quickly. Slow loading can significantly impair the experience for users on poor connections.\n- **No conveyance of action:** If an image is a link or button, its text alternative must describe the action of the link/button, not just the image itself (e.g., `alt=\"View product details\"`).\n- **Contrast for text in images:** If the image contains critical text, ensure that the text meets WCAG contrast standards within the image itself.\n",
