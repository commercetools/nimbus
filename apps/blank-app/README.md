# Nimbus Blank App Template

This directory serves as a template for creating basic applications that utilize
Nimbus. It provides a starting point for new app development within the Nimbus
ecosystem.

## Creating a New App

To create a new application (e.g., `fancy-app`) based on this template, follow
these steps:

1.  **Duplicate the folder:** Copy the entire `blank-app` directory within the
    `apps` directory.
2.  **Rename:** Rename the duplicated folder to your desired app name in
    kebab-case (e.g., `fancy-app`).
3.  **Update `package.json`:** Open the `package.json` file inside your new app
    folder (e.g., `apps/fancy-app/package.json`) and change the `name` property
    to match your folder name (e.g., `"name": "fancy-app"`).
4.  **Install dependencies:** Run `pnpm install` from the root directory of the
    repository. This will install dependencies for all workspaces, including
    your new app.
5.  **Navigate to your app:** Change your current directory to your new app's
    folder (e.g., `cd apps/fancy-app`).
6.  **Start the development server:** Run `pnpm dev` to start the Vite
    development server for your application.

> [!NOTE] This template is based on Vite's `react-swc-ts` template with minor
> adjustments:
>
> 1. The `package.json` includes references to Nimbus catalog dependencies.
> 2. The default ESLint configuration generated by Vite has been removed, as a
>    root-level ESLint configuration is already present in the repository.
