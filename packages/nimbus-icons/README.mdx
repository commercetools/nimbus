# Icons

Icons come from a separate package. Each Icon is a react component that can be
used in any other component.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you can't find a fitting Icon, you may want to use the external
> [material ui icon search](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/?theme=Outlined&query=access#search-material-icons)
> as the search below does not have access to Icon meta-data, only to
> component-names.

Here is the list of available icons:
