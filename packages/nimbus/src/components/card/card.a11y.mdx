## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Card.Root cardPadding="md" borderStyle="outlined" elevation="elevated">
    <Box backgroundColor="#FDE3E3" width="5600" height="500"></Box>
  </Card.Root>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Non-text content:** Provide descriptive alternative text (`alt` attribute)
  for images within cards.
- **Info and relationships:** Use semantic HTML to structure the card content
  logically (e.g., headings, lists).
- **Color contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and
  background within the card.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** Ensure the entire card or its primary interactive
  elements are focusable and operable using only a keyboard.
- **Focus visible:** Provide a clear visual focus indicator when the card or its
  interactive elements are focused.
- **Target size:** If the card is interactive, ensure touch target sizes are
  adequate.
- **Meaningful sequence:** Ensure the content within the card is presented in a
  logical order.
- **Labels or instructions:** Provide clear labels or instructions for form
  elements within cards.
- **Semantic HTML:** Use semantic HTML to ensure compatibility with assistive
  technologies.
- **Avoid complex interactive cards:** Avoid making the entire card a single
  interactive element if it contains multiple distinct actions, to ensure proper
  interaction for assistive technology users.
