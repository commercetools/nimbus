A versatile container component presents self-contained information, often
combining text, images, and actions, making it ideal for displaying summaries or
content previews.

## Overview

This versatile container component often integrates text, images, and actions.
Interaction methods differ: some are clickable, others use buttons and links,
and some are purely informational, grouping content without direct interaction.

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Card.Root cardPadding="md" borderStyle="outlined" elevation="elevated">
    <Box backgroundColor="#FDE3E3" width="5600" height="500"></Box>
  </Card.Root>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

#### 1. Perceivable:

- **1.1.1 Non-text Content:** Provide descriptive alternative text (alt
  attribute) for images within cards.
- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships:** Use semantic HTML to structure the card
  content logically (e.g., headings, lists).
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text
  and background within the card.

#### 2. Operable:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard:** Ensure the entire card or its primary interactive elements
  are focusable and operable using only a keyboard.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible:** Provide a clear visual focus indicator when the card
  or its interactive elements are focused.
- **2.5.8 Target Size (Level AAA in WCAG 2.2):** If the card is interactive,
  ensure touch target sizes are adequate.

#### 3. Understandable:

- **1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence:** Ensure the content within the card is presented
  in a logical order.
- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions:** Provide clear labels or instructions for
  form elements within cards.

#### 4. Robust:

- Use semantic HTML to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.
- Avoid making the entire card a single interactive element if it contains
  multiple distinct actions, to ensure proper interaction for assistive
  technology users.
