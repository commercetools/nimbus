A versatile container component presents self-contained information, often
combining text, images, and actions, making it ideal for displaying summaries or

## Overview

This versatile container component often integrates text, images, and actions.
Interaction methods differ: some are clickable, others use buttons and links,
and some are purely informational, grouping content without direct interaction.
