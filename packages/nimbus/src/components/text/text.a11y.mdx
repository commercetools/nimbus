## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="400">
    <Text as="h2" fontSize="600" fontWeight="700">Header text</Text>
    <Text>Body text</Text>
    <Text textTransform="uppercase" letterSpacing="1px" fontSize="350">CAPTIONS</Text>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Contrast:** The explicit rule of using color step 11 for colored text
  ensures that colored text meets or exceeds minimum WCAG contrast ratios
  against light backgrounds.
- **Semantic HTML:** Ensure that text styles map correctly to semantic HTML tags
  (e.g., Headlines should use `<h1>` through `<h6>`).
- **Truncation:** For long body copy or component-specific labels, define clear
  rules for truncation (using ellipses) and ensure a tooltip reveals the full
  text on hover/focus.
- **Avoid overlap:** Never overlap text elements or place complex colored
  backgrounds behind text, as this voids the consistent contrast guaranteed by
  the defined color scale.
- **Scale usage:** Only use component-specific styles (e.g., button md) for
  their intended purpose; do not use them to style arbitrary body text.
