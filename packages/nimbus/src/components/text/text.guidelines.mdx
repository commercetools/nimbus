## Guidelines

The purpose of these guidelines is to establish a clear typographic hierarchy, optimize content readability, and enforce accessibility standards.

### Best practices

- **Keep hierarchy consistent:** Use a limited, predefined set of text styles to maintain visual consistency across all products. Add custom styles with caution.
- **Prioritize line length:** Use optimal line lengths (typically 50 to 75 characters per line) to prevent eye strain and facilitate reading.
- **Use concise language:** Write clearly, avoiding unnecessary jargon or overly long sentences to reduce cognitive load.
- **Break up content:** Use short paragraphs, lists, and headings to break up large blocks of text, making content easier to scan.
- **Maintain consistent tone:** The language, style, and formality should be consistent throughout the application, reflecting the brand's voice.
- **Handle truncation gracefully:** When necessary, truncate long text with ellipses and provide a tooltip or interaction element to reveal the full content.
- **Keep length in mind for translation:** When supporting text localization, length can expand more than 20%. Design experiences that can be flexible to shortening and lengthening of content.

### Text Do's and Don'ts

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use predefined headings, body sizes, and weights to clearly signal the importance of content.
> - Always maintain sufficient contrast between text and its background to meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum).
> - Keep line length between 50 to 75 characters to maximize reading speed and comfort.
> - Ensure adequate vertical spacing (line-height) to prevent text lines from colliding and improve readability.
> - Write clearly, avoiding unnecessary jargon and overly long sentences.
> - Utilize short paragraphs, bullet points, and headings to make content scannable.
> - Ensure any text used within images or icons has a text alternative or aria-label for screen readers.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Avoid introducing too many different font sizes, weights, or families, which destroys visual consistency.
> - Never use color as the only method to convey meaning (e.g., indicating an error solely with red text).
> - Avoid excessively long lines of text (over 80 characters), which makes tracking difficult and causes fatigue.
> - Avoid line heights that are too small, which makes text visually dense and difficult to read.
> - Never truncate text without providing a clear way (like a tooltip) to view the full content.
> - Avoid pairing text colors that barely distinguish themselves from the background, even if they look "stylish."
> - Stick to the approved typeface(s) in your design system.
