# Text

Text styles are predefined collections of typography rules (including font-size, font-weight, line-height, and letter-spacing) that create reusable, consistent styles.

## Overview

Readable and consistent text styling is important to creating effective user friendly and efficient products. These styles and tools will help give the building blocks and provide more options for creation, and there are still ways to allow for customization for the rare cases it is needed.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Typographic Scale and Hierarchy

Text styles here are recommended for most body styled text, and made to fit well with component sizes. If you need to render large, bold text with a semantic meaning, you should use the heading component instead.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="400">
    <Box>
      <Text textStyle="md">
        Paragraph md - Primary body text, long descriptions, standard content blocks.
      </Text>
    </Box>
    <Box>
      <Text textStyle="sm">
        Paragraph sm - Secondary text, metadata, table content.
      </Text>
    </Box>
    <Box>
      <Text textStyle="xs">
        Paragraph xs - Tertiary content, small notes, timestamps.
      </Text>
    </Box>
    <Box>
      <Text textStyle="caption">
        CAPTION - Used for specialized, tracked metadata. (Includes letter-spacing: 1px).
      </Text>
    </Box>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Text Tones and Semantic Coloring

Text tones use color to semantically convey status, intent, or hierarchy. The default tone is used for the majority of UI text.

**Color Rule:** All colored font-color is always set to step 11 of the given color scale (e.g., tomato.11, indigo.11). This ensures high contrast and accessibility.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="400">
    <Text color="fg">Default tone - Standard body copy, primary content.</Text>
    <Text color="fg.subtle">Secondary - Helper text, metadata, inactive or less important UI elements.</Text>
    <Text color="primary.11">Primary - Mainly used for links or branded messages.</Text>
    <Text color="info.11">Info - Non-critical feedback, system messages.</Text>
    <Text color="positive.11">Positive - Successful actions, positive status indicators (e.g., "Complete," "Saved").</Text>
    <Text color="critical.11">Critical - Validation errors, destructive warnings, critical status indicators.</Text>
    <Text color="warning.11">Warning - Warnings, temporary issues, actions requiring review.</Text>
  </Stack>
)
```

## Guidelines

The purpose of these guidelines is to establish a clear typographic hierarchy, optimize content readability, and enforce accessibility standards.

### Best practices

- **Keep hierarchy consistent:** Use a limited, predefined set of text styles to maintain visual consistency across all products. Add custom styles with caution.
- **Prioritize line length:** Use optimal line lengths (typically 50 to 75 characters per line) to prevent eye strain and facilitate reading.
- **Use concise language:** Write clearly, avoiding unnecessary jargon or overly long sentences to reduce cognitive load.
- **Break up content:** Use short paragraphs, lists, and headings to break up large blocks of text, making content easier to scan.
- **Maintain consistent tone:** The language, style, and formality should be consistent throughout the application, reflecting the brand's voice.
- **Handle truncation gracefully:** When necessary, truncate long text with ellipses and provide a tooltip or interaction element to reveal the full content.
- **Keep length in mind for translation:** When supporting text localization, length can expand more than 20%. Design experiences that can be flexible to shortening and lengthening of content.

### Text Do's and Don'ts

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use predefined headings, body sizes, and weights to clearly signal the importance of content.
> - Always maintain sufficient contrast between text and its background to meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum).
> - Keep line length between 50 to 75 characters to maximize reading speed and comfort.
> - Ensure adequate vertical spacing (line-height) to prevent text lines from colliding and improve readability.
> - Write clearly, avoiding unnecessary jargon and overly long sentences.
> - Utilize short paragraphs, bullet points, and headings to make content scannable.
> - Ensure any text used within images or icons has a text alternative or aria-label for screen readers.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Avoid introducing too many different font sizes, weights, or families, which destroys visual consistency.
> - Never use color as the only method to convey meaning (e.g., indicating an error solely with red text).
> - Avoid excessively long lines of text (over 80 characters), which makes tracking difficult and causes fatigue.
> - Avoid line heights that are too small, which makes text visually dense and difficult to read.
> - Never truncate text without providing a clear way (like a tooltip) to view the full content.
> - Avoid pairing text colors that barely distinguish themselves from the background, even if they look "stylish."
> - Stick to the approved typeface(s) in your design system.

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="400">
    <Text as="h2" fontSize="600" fontWeight="700">Header text</Text>
    <Text>Body text</Text>
    <Text textTransform="uppercase" letterSpacing="1px" fontSize="350">CAPTIONS</Text>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Accessibility Standards

- **Contrast:** The explicit rule of using color step 11 for colored text ensures that colored text meets or exceeds minimum WCAG contrast ratios against light backgrounds.
- **Semantic HTML:** Ensure that text styles map correctly to semantic HTML tags (e.g., Headlines should use `<h1>` through `<h6>`).
- **Truncation:** For long body copy or component-specific labels, define clear rules for truncation (using ellipses) and ensure a tooltip reveals the full text on hover/focus.
- **Avoid Overlap:** Never overlap text elements or place complex colored backgrounds behind text, as this voids the consistent contrast guaranteed by the defined color scale.
- **Scale Usage:** Only use component-specific styles (e.g., button md) for their intended purpose; do not use them to style arbitrary body text.
