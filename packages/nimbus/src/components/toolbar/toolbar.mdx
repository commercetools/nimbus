# Toolbar

Toolbars organize related actions and controls in a compact bar for easy access.
They provide consistent placement for common or contextual tasks within an
application.

## Overview

A toolbar is a handy container that organizes a group of related buttons and
tools, using both horizontal and vertical layouts to fit the screen;
essentially, it gives users quick access to the most common actions they need
right now.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visual options

#### Horizontal

Most commonly used, horizontal toolbars should sit above the content meant to be
altered.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Toolbar orientation="horizontal">
    <Group>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatBold />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatItalic />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatUnderlined />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.MoreHoriz />
      </IconButton>
    </Group>
    <Separator orientation="vertical" />
    <Group>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatListBulleted />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatListNumbered />
      </IconButton>
    </Group>
  </Toolbar>
)
```

#### Vertical

Vertical toolbars are less common, but in the right interface it can be more
helpful than a horizontal placement.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Toolbar orientation="vertical">
    <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.FormatBold />
    </IconButton>
    <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.FormatItalic />
    </IconButton>
    <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.FormatUnderlined />
    </IconButton>
    <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.MoreHoriz />
    </IconButton>
  </Toolbar>
)
```

#### Plain and outline

Two versions are available, a plain version that has a slight shadow to lift,
and an outlined version that has more contrast from elements around it. The
plain version without an outline is most common.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="600" alignItems="center">
    <Toolbar variant="plain" size="xs">
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatBold />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatItalic />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatUnderlined />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.MoreHoriz />
      </IconButton>
    </Toolbar>

    <Toolbar variant="outline" size="xs">
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatBold />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatItalic />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatUnderlined />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.MoreHoriz />
      </IconButton>
    </Toolbar>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Groups

Grouping similar tools is a common best practice within all toolbars. Please
combine similar tools in groups to make it easier for users to make choices
quickly. If there are a lot of tools within a group, fold them under a menu
button and leave 2-3 out that are the most popular choices.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Toolbar size="xs">
    <Group>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatBold />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatItalic />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatUnderlined />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.MoreHoriz />
      </IconButton>
    </Group>
    <Separator orientation="vertical" />
    <Group>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatListBulleted />
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton size="xs" variant="ghost">
        <Icons.FormatListNumbered />
      </IconButton>
    </Group>
  </Toolbar>
)
```

## Guidelines

These guidelines provide comprehensive direction for designing and developing
toolbars within Nimbus.

### Best practices

- **Contextual placement:** Place the toolbar directly above the content it
  controls (e.g., above a text editor, above a data table). This ensures an
  immediate, clear connection between the tools and the content being modified.
- **Logical grouping:** Group related actions visually using small separators
  (like vertical lines or subtle spacing) to aid readability. For example, group
  text alignment controls together, and export actions together.
- **Hierarchical order:** Arrange items based on usage frequency and logical
  flow, placing the most common or primary actions prominently on the left (in
  LTR languages).
- **Minimize clutter:** Avoid overcrowding the toolbar. If there are too many
  items, use secondary controls like overflow menus to hide less frequently used
  actions.

### Usage

A toolbar's use is to provide a dedicated, contextual area for a set of related,
frequently used actions and controls to manage the content directly below it.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Group related actions and controls** in a compact, container.
- **Offer contextual actions** relevant to the content being viewed or edited
  (e.g., formatting options in a text editor, or bulk actions for a list or
  table).
- **Maintain screen space** by consolidating many items into a single, compact
  bar.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **The primary purpose is navigation** between different pages or application
  views; use a navigation component or tabs instead.
- **Actions are rarely used or require complex input;** use a menu or modal
  dialog to house these actions to simplify.
- **The area needs to display a large amount of primary content** without being
  obscured.
- **Only one or two actions are needed** for a view; consider placing these
  directly or within a relevant component, like a card.

### Toolbar in use

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do group related actions and controls in a compact container.
> - Offer contextual actions relevant to the content being viewed or edited
>   (e.g., formatting options in a text editor, or bulk actions for a list).
> - Maintain screen space by consolidating many items into a single, compact
>   bar.

![Do](/images/toolbar/toolbar-do.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't overcrowd the toolbar with too many items; use an overflow menu
>   instead.
> - Don't place unrelated actions next to each other without visual separation
>   to group similar functions.
> - Don't use a standard text button with a label when an icon button is
>   sufficient and space is limited.
> - Don't assume the user understands an icon without a descriptive tooltip.
> - Don't hide actions that are temporarily disabled, as this causes shifting
>   elements and breaks muscle memory.

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

### Accessibility standards

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements within the toolbar are navigable using the tab key in a logical order, following the order of items.
- **ARIA Roles:** Apply the ARIA role toolbar to the container element.
- **Labeling:** Provide descriptive, concise aria-labels for the toolbar container and for all icon buttons to ensure screen reader users understand the component's purpose and the action it performs.
- **Provide clear status:**
  - Use the disabled state for actions that are temporarily unavailable. Do not hide actions that are simply disabled, as this can cause shifting layouts and confuse users.
  - Clearly communicate the reason an action is disabled via tooltips or other contextual help.
