## Guidelines

These guidelines provide comprehensive direction for designing and developing
toolbars within Nimbus.

### Best practices

- **Contextual placement:** Place the toolbar directly above the content it
  controls (e.g., above a text editor, above a data table). This ensures an
  immediate, clear connection between the tools and the content being modified.
- **Logical grouping:** Group related actions visually using small separators
  (like vertical lines or subtle spacing) to aid readability. For example, group
  text alignment controls together, and export actions together.
- **Hierarchical order:** Arrange items based on usage frequency and logical
  flow, placing the most common or primary actions prominently on the left (in
  LTR languages).
- **Minimize clutter:** Avoid overcrowding the toolbar. If there are too many
  items, use secondary controls like overflow menus to hide less frequently used
  actions.

### Usage

A toolbar's use is to provide a dedicated, contextual area for a set of related,
frequently used actions and controls to manage the content directly below it.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Group related actions and controls** in a compact, container.
- **Offer contextual actions** relevant to the content being viewed or edited
  (e.g., formatting options in a text editor, or bulk actions for a list or
  table).
- **Maintain screen space** by consolidating many items into a single, compact
  bar.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **The primary purpose is navigation** between different pages or application
  views; use a navigation component or tabs instead.
- **Actions are rarely used or require complex input;** use a menu or modal
  dialog to house these actions to simplify.
- **The area needs to display a large amount of primary content** without being
  obscured.
- **Only one or two actions are needed** for a view; consider placing these
  directly or within a relevant component, like a card.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't overcrowd the toolbar with too many items; use an overflow menu
>   instead.
> - Don't place unrelated actions next to each other without visual separation
>   to group similar functions.
> - Don't use a standard text button with a label when an icon button is
>   sufficient and space is limited.
> - Don't assume the user understands an icon without a descriptive tooltip.
> - Don't hide actions that are temporarily disabled, as this causes shifting
>   elements and breaks muscle memory.
