## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="solid"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More publish options"
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="publish-next">Publish and open next</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save">Save as draft</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Keyboard navigation:** The component must be fully keyboard accessible. The
  Tab key should focus on the primary button first.
- **Dual focus:** The primary action and the dropdown trigger must be treated as
  two distinct focusable elements or as a single component where the arrow key
  can be used to open the menu once the button is focused.
- **ARIA roles:** The primary button uses role="button". The dropdown trigger
  should use role="button" combined with aria-haspopup="true" to indicate that
  it controls a pop-up menu.
- **Labeling:** Provide clear, unique aria-label text for both the primary
  action and the dropdown trigger to ensure screen readers convey the intended
  function of each segment.
