# SplitButton

A split button merges a main action with a dropdown for related, less common actions.

## Overview

A split button merges a main action that is immediate with a secondary dropdown menu that holds related actions that are used less often. This component provides quick access to essential functions while offering a complete list of options, all while saving space.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visuals

#### Solid

Most common styling of the split button. Try to keep only one solid primary toned button in an area for user clarity for the most important task. Too many in an area can cause confusion.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="solid"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More publish options"
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save-publish">Save and Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save-next">Save and Open Next</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

#### Outlined

Outlined styled buttons are for secondary or less important actions.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="outline"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More publish options"
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save-publish">Save and Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save-next">Save and Open Next</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

#### Ghost
 
Ghost styled buttons are helpful for UI simplification. You will find these in smaller sizes within places like toolbars.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="ghost"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More publish options"
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save-publish">Save and Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save-next">Save and Open Next</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

### Icons and placement

Using icons with split buttons is possible, both on the right and left side. Please keep consistency in mind for icons and placements with other patterns that are nearby. 

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" gap="400" alignItems="center">
    <SplitButton
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More document actions"
      icon={<Icons.Share />}
    >
      <Menu.Item id="share">Share Document</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="copy-link">Copy Link</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
    <SplitButton
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="Even more document actions"
      icon={<Icons.Share />}
    >
      <Menu.Item id="share-again">Share Document</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="copy-link-again">Copy Link</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
    </Stack>
  )

```

### Size

There are three sizes to switch buttons, the default size is medium (md), extra small (xs), and 2x-small (2xs).

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" gap="400" alignItems="center">
    <SplitButton tone="primary" size="md" onAction={(id) => {}} aria-label="publish options">
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="option2">Option 2</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
    <SplitButton tone="primary" size="xs" onAction={(id) => {}} aria-label="publish options">
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="option2">Option 2</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
    <SplitButton tone="primary" size="2xs" onAction={(id) => {}} aria-label="publish options">
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="option2">Option 2</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  </Stack>
)
```

## Guidelines

The SplitButton provides a space-efficient way to present a primary action
alongside related secondary actions, maintaining visual hierarchy while offering
comprehensive functionality.

### Best practices

- **Clear primary action:** The main button segment must perform the most common or default action immediately upon being clicked. The label must be clear and action-oriented.
  - **If there is no default action** and you still want to use a button with a dropdown menu, consider using the menu component with a regular button (with a dropdown icon) as a trigger. In this case, the dropdown menu will open always when clicking the button and no default action will be triggered. Especially useful when all actions are equally important
- **Visual distinction:** Clearly separate the primary action button from the dropdown trigger. This visually communicates that the two segments perform different functions.
- **Dropdown content:** Keep the list of secondary actions concise and logically ordered (by frequency or relevance).
- **State persistence:** When a user selects a secondary action from the dropdown, consider making that action the new primary button action if the user is likely to repeat it, or if it fits the new context.
- **Sizing and responsiveness:** Ensure both the primary button and the dropdown trigger have adequate touch target sizes. The dropdown menu should be positioned to avoid obscuring important content and should adapt well on mobile devices.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use
- **Primary action focus:** Use a split button when one specific action (e.g., "Save," "Download") is performed significantly more often than its related alternatives (e.g., "Save and Share," "Download as PDF").
- **Contextual actions:** The dropdown menu must contain actions that are directly related to the primary button's function.
- **Space efficiency:** Use split buttons in toolbars or dense interfaces where presenting every option as a full button would lead to clutter.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use
- **When all actions are equally important:** Don't use a split button if all the related actions are performed with equal frequency or importance. Grouping them this way implies hierarchy where none exists, and a simple button group or vertical menu list might be clearer.
- **When actions are unrelated:** Avoid grouping actions that have no logical connection under the same component. The primary button and all dropdown options must share a clear, single context.
- **When the primary action changes frequently:** If the default action changes based on complex context or user state, constantly swapping the main button label can confuse the user and create visual instability. Use a standard dropdown menu where all options, including the default, are consistently located inside.
- **When discovery Is crucial:** If users must know all available options (e.g., legally required export formats), burying them in a secondary dropdown menu is a poor choice. Displaying them as separate full buttons or in an obvious button group is better.
- **For primary navigation:** A split button is an action control, not a primary navigation tool. Using it to link to major sections can confuse users about whether they are performing an action or moving to a new page.
- **When screen space Is not an issue:** If you have ample space, displaying the top two or three most common actions as individual, labeled buttons can sometimes be faster and more transparent than hiding them in a dropdown.
- **When the dropdown contains complex controls:** Avoid filling the dropdown with complex inputs, multi-step forms, or large amounts of text. A split button dropdown should only contain simple, single-click actions.

### Split buttons in use

> [!TIP]\
> Do
>- Do prioritize the primary action. Ensure the main, large section performs the most common or default action immediately upon being clicked.
>- Do group related actions. Include only closely related actions in the secondary dropdown menu.
>- Do keep the dropdown menu concise. It should contain simple, single-click actions, not complex forms or long text.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="solid"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More publish options"
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish changes</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save-publish">Save and Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save-next">Save and Open Next</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> Don't
>- Don’t add icons that don’t make sense with the action. If one uses an icon, all options should have a corresponding icon. Don’t use icons on both sides. 
>- Don't dynamically swap the primary button's function based on minor changes in the user's state.
>- Don't group actions that have different contexts or objectives.
>- Don't use a split button as a primary site navigation tool.
>- Don't hide legally required or critical options in the dropdown.
>- Don't use the dropdown to house long forms, multi-step processes, or complex configuration settings.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="solid"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="ridiculous actions"
      icon={<Icons.Snowshoeing/>}
    >
      <Menu.Item id="download">Download Report</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="buy-socks">Buy Socks</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="delete-account">Delete Account</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="go-home">Go to Homepage</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="accept-terms">Accept Terms</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="solid"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More publish options"
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save-publish">Save and Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save-next">Save and Open Next</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility Standards

- **Keyboard Navigation:** The component must be fully keyboard accessible. The Tab key should focus on the primary button first.
- **Dual Focus:** The primary action and the dropdown trigger must be treated as two distinct focusable elements or as a single component where the arrow key can be used to open the menu once the button is focused.
- **ARIA Roles:** The primary button uses role="button". The dropdown trigger should use role="button" combined with aria-haspopup="true" to indicate that it controls a pop-up menu.
- **Labeling:** Provide clear, unique aria-label text for both the primary action and the dropdown trigger to ensure screen readers convey the intended function of each segment.
