# Split button

A split button merges a main action with a dropdown for related, less common actions.

## Overview

A split button merges a main action that is immediate with a secondary dropdown menu that holds related actions that are used less often. This component provides quick access to essential functions while offering a complete list of options, all while saving space.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visuals

#### Solid

Most common styling of the split button. Try to keep only one solid primary toned button in an area for user clarity for the most important task. Too many in an area can cause confusion.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="solid"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More publish options"
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="publish-next">Publish and open next</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save">Save as draft</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

#### Outlined

Outlined styled buttons are for secondary or less important actions.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="outline"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More publish options"
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="publish-next">Publish and open next</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save">Save as draft</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

#### Ghost
 
Ghost styled buttons are helpful for UI simplification. You will find these in smaller sizes within places like toolbars.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="ghost"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More publish options"
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="publish-next">Publish and open next</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save">Save as draft</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

### Icons

Keep consistency in mind for icons and consider other patterns that are nearby. 

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
    <SplitButton
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More document actions"
      icon={<Icons.Share />}
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="publish-next">Publish and open next</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save">Save as draft</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  )

```

### Size

There are three sizes to split buttons, the default size is medium (md), extra small (xs), and 2x-small (2xs).

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" gap="400" alignItems="center">
    <SplitButton tone="primary" size="md" onAction={(id) => {}} aria-label="publish options">
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="publish-next">Publish and open next</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save">Save as draft</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
    <SplitButton tone="primary" size="xs" onAction={(id) => {}} aria-label="publish options">
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="publish-next">Publish and open next</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save">Save as draft</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
    <SplitButton tone="primary" size="2xs" onAction={(id) => {}} aria-label="publish options">
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="publish-next">Publish and open next</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save">Save as draft</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  </Stack>
)
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <SplitButton
      variant="solid"
      tone="primary"
      onAction={(actionId) => alert(`Action: ${actionId}`)}
      aria-label="More publish options"
    >
      <Menu.Item id="publish">Publish</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="publish-next">Publish and open next</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="save">Save as draft</Menu.Item>
    </SplitButton>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility Standards

- **Keyboard Navigation:** The component must be fully keyboard accessible. The Tab key should focus on the primary button first.
- **Dual Focus:** The primary action and the dropdown trigger must be treated as two distinct focusable elements or as a single component where the arrow key can be used to open the menu once the button is focused.
- **ARIA Roles:** The primary button uses role="button". The dropdown trigger should use role="button" combined with aria-haspopup="true" to indicate that it controls a pop-up menu.
- **Labeling:** Provide clear, unique aria-label text for both the primary action and the dropdown trigger to ensure screen readers convey the intended function of each segment.
