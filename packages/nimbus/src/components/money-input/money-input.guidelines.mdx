## Guidelines

Money input guidelines offer best practice and usage guides to keep user experience accessible and familiar, ensuring consistency and high ease of use.

### Best practices

- **Default currency:** Pre-select the most common or local currency for the user based on location or historical data to minimize input effort.
- **Clear labeling:** Always use a persistent, descriptive label (e.g., "Product price," "Shipping cost") and ensure the currency field and numerical input are visually grouped as one component.
- **Validation feedback:** Provide immediate, clear, and action-oriented error messages and visual cues when validation fails (e.g., input is non-numeric, or violates range constraints).
- **Precision guidance:** Utilize the "High precision price" tooltip or similar mechanisms to explain special input requirements for decimal places or specific pricing rules.
- **Logical currency ordering:** Order the currency dropdown options logically, typically placing the most common currencies first, followed by an alphabetical list.

### Usage

Utilizing money input should be consistent, and relevant for the data needed.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Currency flexibility:** When the user must select the currency alongside the value. Recording multiple prices that are specific to currency.
- **Price configuration:** For setting product prices, discounts, taxes, or inventory costs in a back-office system.
- **Transactional input:** When capturing any customer-facing input that involves currency and payment (e.g., donation amount).

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Simple currency display:** Do not use the full input component just to display a currency value. Use formatted text instead.
- **Pure numerical data:** If the input is only a number and does not involve money, use a standard number input.
- **Fixed currency:** If the currency is guaranteed to be fixed (e.g., always USD) and selection is not required, use a standard text input with a fixed currency symbol/label appended.

### Money input in use

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do make both the currency selector and the number input easily accessible.
> - Do provide helper text or tooltips (like the "High precision price" tooltip) for complex constraints.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState({
    amount: "20.12345",
    currencyCode: "EUR"
  });

  return (
    <FormField.Root>
      <FormField.Label>Product Price</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <MoneyInput
          value={value}
          onValueChange={setValue}
          currencies={["EUR", "USD", "GBP"]}
          hasHighPrecisionBadge
        />
      </FormField.Input>
      <FormField.Description>
        High precision pricing available for detailed financial accuracy
      </FormField.Description>
    </FormField.Root>
  );
}
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't hide the currency selector if the currency is not fixed.
> - Don't use a money input if there is a default single currency or if the number does not represent a currency.
> - Don't allow users to submit the form with an invalid or incorrectly formatted currency or number.
> - Don't use lengthy error messages; keep them concise and focus on the solution.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState({
    amount: "20",
    currencyCode: "EUR"
  });

  return (
    <FormField.Root isInvalid>
      <FormField.Label>Product Price</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <MoneyInput
          value={value}
          onValueChange={setValue}
          currencies={["EUR"]}
          isInvalid
          width="100%"
        />
      </FormField.Input>
      <FormField.Error>
        FATAL CLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION FAILURE: The input string for the Product Price field did not pass the REGEX matching criteria for the accepted numeric float and currency locale object structure. Data integrity requires a value greater than the currently defined minimum threshold, which is configured for 30.00 base units, and must contain two trailing decimal places, regardless of whether the final calculated value is a whole integer.
      </FormField.Error>
    </FormField.Root>
