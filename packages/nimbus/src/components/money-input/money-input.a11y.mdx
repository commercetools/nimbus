## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState({
    amount: "20.00",
    currencyCode: "EUR"
  });

  return (
    <MoneyInput
      value={value}
      onValueChange={setValue}
      currencies={["EUR", "USD", "GBP"]}
    />
  );
}
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Keyboard operability:** Ensure the user can navigate seamlessly between the
  currency selector and the number input using the tab key.
- **ARIA roles:** The currency selector should function as an accessible
  dropdown/select menu, while the number input should use the appropriate number
  input type.
- **Error communication:** Validation errors must be announced to screen
  readers. The invalid state should use `aria-invalid="true"` on the input field
  and link to the error message via `aria-describedby`.
- **Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text, borders, and
  icons, especially in the `invalid` and `disabled` states.
- **Focus indication:** Maintain a strong, clear focus ring around both the
  currency menu and the number input when active.
