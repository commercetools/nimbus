## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root>
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        Headline
        <Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
          <IconButton colorPalette="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.Edit />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton colorPalette="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.PushPin />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton colorPalette="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.FileCopy />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton colorPalette="critical" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.Delete />
          </IconButton>
        </Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content goes here</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Use appropriate HTML elements:** Use `<button>` for headers controlling
  panels. Employ separate elements for content panels. Establish clear
  relationships between triggers and content programmatically.
- **Headings:** Utilize heading elements (`<h3>`, `<h2>`, etc.) for accordion
  headers. Provide semantic structure for navigation by assistive technologies.
- **ARIA Roles:** Apply `role="region"` to content panels for landmark
  identification.
- **aria-expanded:** Dynamically update on the `<button>` controlling the panel.
  `aria-expanded="true"` for visible panels. `aria-expanded="false"` for hidden
  panels.
- **aria-controls:** Set on the `<button>` to reference the id of its controlled
  content panel. Explicitly link the button to the content.
- **aria-labelledby:** Apply to the content panel (with `role="region"`).
  Reference the id of the accordion's header button.
- **Keyboard navigation:** Ensure full keyboard operability. Allow focus to
  reach each accordion header (`<button>`) using Tab. Enable toggling panel
  visibility using Space or Enter on focused headers. Consider arrow key
  navigation between headers (enhancement).
- **Focus visible:** Provide a clear visual focus indicator for focused
  accordion headers (`<button>`). Assist keyboard users in identifying the
  selected element.
- **Content visibility for assistive technologies:** Ensure content of collapsed
  panels is not focusable via keyboard and hidden from screen readers (e.g.,
  `aria-hidden="true"`, `display: none`).
- **Color contrast:** Maintain sufficient color contrast for text within headers
  and content panels. Ensure readability against background colors.
- **Clear indicators:** Provide visual cues for expanded/collapsed states (e.g.,
  arrows, +/-). Hide decorative indicators from screen readers
  (`aria-hidden="true"`).
- **Avoid less accessible methods:** Avoid relying solely on `<details>` and
  `<summary>` for complex accordions. ARIA attributes offer more reliable and
  controllable accessibility.
