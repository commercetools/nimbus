## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root>
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        Headline
        <Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
          <IconButton colorPalette="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.Edit />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton colorPalette="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.PushPin />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton colorPalette="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.FileCopy />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton colorPalette="critical" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.Delete />
          </IconButton>
        </Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content goes here</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

### Accessibility standards

#### 1. Structure and semantics:

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships:** Use appropriate HTML elements to structure
  the accordion. Employ `<button>` for headers controlling panels. Use separate
  elements for content panels. Establish clear relationships between triggers
  and content programmatically.
- **Headings:** Utilize heading elements (`<h3>`, `<h2>`, etc.) for accordion
  headers. Provide semantic structure for navigation by assistive technologies.

#### 2. ARIA attributes:

- **ARIA Roles:** Apply `role="region"` to content panels for landmark
  identification.
- **aria-expanded:** Dynamically update on the \<button\> controlling the panel.
  `aria-expanded="true"` for visible panels. `aria-expanded="false"` for hidden
  panels.
- **aria-controls:** Set on the \<button\> to reference the id of its controlled
  content panel. Explicitly link the button to the content.
- **aria-labelledby:** Apply to the content panel (with `role="region"`).
  Reference the id of the accordion's header button.

#### 3. Keyboard navigation:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard:** Ensure full keyboard operability. Allow focus to reach
  each accordion header (`<button>`) using Tab. Enable toggling panel visibility
  using Space or Enter on focused headers. Consider arrow key navigation between
  headers (enhancement).

#### 4. Visibility and focus:

- **2.4.7 Focus Visible:** Provide a clear visual focus indicator for focused
  accordion headers (`<button>`). Assist keyboard users in identifying the
  selected element.

#### 5. Content visibility (for assistive technologies):

- **Ensure content of collapsed panels is:** Not focusable via keyboard. Hidden
  from screen readers (e.g., `aria-hidden="true"`, `display: none`).

#### 6. Color contrast:

- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):** Maintain sufficient color contrast for text
  within headers and content panels. Ensure readability against background
  colors.

#### 7. Clear indicators:

- Provide visual cues for expanded/collapsed states (e.g., arrows, +/-). Hide
  decorative indicators from screen readers (`aria-hidden="true"`).

#### 8. Avoidance of less accessible methods:

- Avoid relying solely on `<details>` and `<summary>` for complex accordions.
  ARIA attributes offer more reliable and controllable accessibility.
