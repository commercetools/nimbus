# Accordion

A component used for organizing contents. This allows users to toggle visibility
of the content sections in their individual panels when the panel's header is
clicked. Accordions are useful when you want to display a large amount of content
in a limited space.



## Basic Usage

The Accordion component consists of a few main parts:
- `Accordion.Root`: The container for all accordion items
- `Accordion.Item`: A single collapsible section
- `Accordion.Header`: The clickable heading/trigger
- `Accordion.Content`: The content that appears/disappears

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
      <Accordion.Header>Test Accordion</Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Test Accordion Content</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
)
```

## Multiple Items

You can add multiple items to an accordion:

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
      <Accordion.Header>First Item</Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content for the first item</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-2">
      <Accordion.Header>Second Item</Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content for the second item</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-3">
      <Accordion.Header>Third Item</Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content for the third item</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
)
```

## Multiple Expanded Items

By default, only one accordion item can be expanded at a time. You can allow multiple items to be expanded simultaneously by using the `allowsMultipleExpanded` prop:

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root allowsMultipleExpanded>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
      <Accordion.Header>First Item</Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content for the first item</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-2">
      <Accordion.Header>Second Item</Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content for the second item</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-3">
      <Accordion.Header>Third Item</Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content for the third item</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
)
```

## Sizes

The Accordion component supports different sizes: `sm` and `md`.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <>
    <h3>Small Size</h3>
    <Accordion.Root size="sm">
      <Accordion.Item value="small">
        <Accordion.Header>Small Accordion</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Content>This is a small size accordion</Accordion.Content>
      </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion.Root>
    
    <h3>Medium Size (Default)</h3>
    <Accordion.Root size="md">
      <Accordion.Item value="medium">
        <Accordion.Header>Medium Accordion</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Content>This is a medium size accordion</Accordion.Content>
      </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion.Root>
  </>
)
```

## Disabled Accordion

You can disable the entire accordion using the `isDisabled` prop:

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root isDisabled>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
      <Accordion.Header>Disabled Accordion</Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>This content cannot be accessed</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
)
```

## Header with Right Content

You can add additional content to the right side of the accordion header using `Accordion.HeaderRightContent`:

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <div>
  
  <Accordion.Root>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
      <Accordion.Header>
        Item With Actions
        <Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
          <Button tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="xs">Related Action</Button>
        </Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>
      Content
      </Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
  </div>
)
```
