# Accordion
---
A collapsable component lets users show and hide sections of related content on a page.



## Overview

The primary difference between accordion types lies in whether they use additional 
controls for accessing information or offer a simple click-to-expand interaction.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Size

#### Medium

The default size for forms.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root>
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        Headline
        <Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.Edit />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.PushPin />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.FileCopy />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="critical" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.Delete />
          </IconButton>
        </Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content goes here</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>

);
```

#### Small

Use for small condensed areas, or if there is a user preference for more condensed forms.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root size="sm">
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        Headline
        <Accordion.HeaderRightContent >
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="sm">
            <Icons.Edit />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="sm">
            <Icons.PushPin />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="sm">
            <Icons.FileCopy />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="critical" variant="ghost" size="sm">
            <Icons.Delete />
          </IconButton>
        </Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content goes here</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>

);
```

### Content

The main use for accordions is for forms and filters. Custom content can be created 
for the body of the accordion.

## Guidelines

Alert guidelines focus on delivering important and timely messages to users in 
a clear, noticeable, and accessible way, ensuring they understand the significance 
of the information and any required actions, while minimizing disruption to their workflow.


### Best practices

- **Label clarity:** Headers must be clear and descriptive so users understand what 
information is contained within each section.
- **Visual cues:** Use clear visual cues to indicate that a section can be expanded 
and its current state. If other icons and controls are present, ensure that their 
use is clear and explained.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure accordions are accessible to users with disabilities, 
including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
- **Avoid nesting too deeply:** Overly nested accordions can become confusing and 
difficult to navigate.

### Common accordion controls

These are some common patterns for accordions controls. These are included in the 
figma library components to make designing common shared uses easier. 

#### Revert and save

This action allows users to discard any unsaved changes they've made to the 
controls since the last successful save or the default settings were loaded.

MISSING CODE


#### Cancel and save

Similar to revert and save, there is a difference in persistence and scope. 
"Revert" often implies going back to a saved state, affecting changes made 
over a longer period, while "Cancel" typically discards unsaved changes 
from the current interaction.

MISSING CODE

#### Four icon buttons

Use up to four icons to allow your user to control the information within the 
associated accordion.


MISSING CODE

#### Delete

Single icon button, this is a common used control, used to delete the 
entire accordion and content. 

MISSING CODE

#### Switch

The use of switch often signals the effect of the settings being applied, 
or activating the content within to be edited by the user.

MISSING CODE

#### Select input

Allowing the users to select from a list. This control often controls the 
type of form that will be shown for user completion.

MISSING CODE

#### Custom controls

If these more typical controls do not suit the needs of your feature, 
create controls that best suit your needs. 

### Usage

Accordions are a versatile component that can effectively manage and present 
information in a concise and organized way, improving usability and saving 
screen space. 

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Lengthy content:** Use an accordion when you have a significant amount of content to display.
- **Logically grouped content:** Use an accordion when the content can be logically grouped under headings.
- **Limited vertical space:** Use an accordion when vertical space is limited.
- **Non-essential information:** Use an accordion when users don't need to see all the information at once.
- **Simplifying complex forms/settings:** Use an accordion when you want to simplify complex forms or settings.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Brief content:** Do not use an accordion when content is brief and easily fits on the screen. Hiding small 
amounts of information behind clicks is unnecessary.
- **Deeply nested content:** Do not use an accordion if the content is deeply nested. Multiple layers of 
accordions can become confusing and difficult to navigate.
- **Outgrowing component:** Do not use an accordion when controls and content are outgrowing the component. 
If the content becomes too complex, consider an alternative UI component.

#### Accordion nesting

Avoid nesting accordions because they hide information and make it hard for users to predict the content of 
deeper nested components. Instead, create simple, well-organized pages that use accordions to hold information 
in meaningful ways for the user.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> 
> - Do organize the right information within accordions, if all closed, users should be able to navigate information easily.

MISSING CODE

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not nest accordions excessively.  
> - Do not use accordion controls when nested to reduce complexity.

MISSING CODE

#### Accordion controls

Make it easy for users to understand what the attached controls do, and how to interact with them when needed.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> 
> - Use tools that the user expects to use in the area to complete their tasks. There should be no confusion 
on what the tools are for and what their effects should be.
> - Include tooltips to describe icon buttons when used.

MISSING CODE

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not add controls that have seemingly no reason to be there for the majority of the users. If certain 
controls require permissions, consider hiding them from certain users to simplify workspaces.

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with 
disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.

### Accessibility Standards

#### 1. Structure and Semantics: 

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships:**  Use appropriate HTML elements to structure the accordion. Employ \<button\> 
for headers controlling panels. Use separate elements for content panels. Establish clear relationships between 
triggers and content programmatically.
- **Headings:** Utilize heading elements (\<h3\>, \<h2\>, etc.) for accordion headers. Provide semantic structure 
for navigation by assistive technologies.

#### 2. ARIA Attributes:

- **ARIA Roles:** Apply `role="region"` to content panels for landmark identification.
- **aria-expanded:** Dynamically update on the \<button\> controlling the panel. 
`aria-expanded="true"` for visible panels. `aria-expanded="false"` for hidden panels.
- **aria-controls:** Set on the \<button\> to reference the id of its controlled content panel. Explicitly link 
the button to the content.
- **aria-labelledby:** Apply to the content panel (with `role="region"`). Reference the id of the accordion's header button.

#### 3. Keyboard Navigation:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard:** Ensure full keyboard operability. Allow focus to reach each accordion header (\<button\>) 
using Tab. Enable toggling panel visibility using Space or Enter on focused headers. Consider arrow key navigation 
between headers (enhancement).

#### 4. Visibility and Focus:

- **2.4.7 Focus Visible:** Provide a clear visual focus indicator for focused accordion headers (\<button\>). 
Assist keyboard users in identifying the selected element.

#### 5. Content Visibility (for Assistive Tech):

- **Ensure content of collapsed panels is:** Not focusable via keyboard. Hidden from screen readers (e.g., 
`aria-hidden="true", display: none`).

#### 6. Color Contrast:

- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):** Maintain sufficient color contrast for text within headers and content panels. 
Ensure readability against background colors.

#### 7. Clear Indicators: 

- Provide visual cues for expanded/collapsed states (e.g., arrows, +/-). Hide decorative indicators from screen 
readers (`aria-hidden="true"`).

#### 8. Avoidance of Less Accessible Methods:

- Avoid relying solely on \<details\> and \<summary\> for complex accordions. ARIA attributes offer 
more reliable and controllable accessibility.
