# Accordion

A collapsable component lets users show and hide sections of related content on
a page.

## Overview

The primary difference between accordion types lies in whether they use
additional controls for accessing information or offer a simple click-to-expand
interaction.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Size

#### Medium

The default size for forms.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root>
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        Headline
        <Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.Edit />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.PushPin />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.FileCopy />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="critical" variant="ghost">
            <Icons.Delete />
          </IconButton>
        </Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content goes here</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>

);
```

#### Small

Use for small condensed areas, or if there is a user preference for more
condensed forms.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root size="sm">
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        Headline
        <Accordion.HeaderRightContent >
          <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="sm">
            <Icons.Edit />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="sm">
            <Icons.PushPin />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="sm">
            <Icons.FileCopy />
          </IconButton>
          <IconButton tone="critical" variant="ghost" size="sm">
            <Icons.Delete />
          </IconButton>
          </Stack>
        </Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>Content goes here</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

### Content

The main use for accordions is for forms and filters. Custom content can be
created for the body of the accordion.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root size="sm">
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        Details
        <Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
          <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
            <Button tone="primary" size="xs" variant="outline">
              <Icons.Undo />
              Revert
            </Button>
            <Button tone="primary" size="xs" variant="solid">
              Save changes
            </Button>
          </Stack>
        </Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>
        First name
        <TextInput size="sm" value="john" w="100%"/>
        <br />
        Last name
        <TextInput size="sm" value="doe" w="100%"/>
        <br />
        Birthday
        <TextInput size="sm" value="10.05.1982" w="100%"/>
      </Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

## Guidelines

Accordion guidelines offer a set of standardized rules and recommendations that
ensure consistency, usability, and accessibility across all design elements and
interactions.

### Best practices

- **Label clarity:** Headers must be clear and descriptive so users understand
  what information is contained within each section.
- **Visual cues:** Use clear visual cues to indicate that a section can be
  expanded and its current state. If other icons and controls are present,
  ensure that their use is clear and explained.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure accordions are accessible to users with
  disabilities, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
- **Avoid nesting too deeply:** Overly nested accordions can become confusing
  and difficult to navigate.

### Common accordion controls

These are some common patterns for accordions controls. These are included in
the figma library components to make designing common shared uses easier.

#### Revert and save

This action allows users to discard any unsaved changes they've made to the
controls since the last successful save or the default settings were loaded.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
    <Button tone="primary" size="xs" variant="outline">
      <Icons.Undo />
      Revert
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="xs" variant="solid">
      Save changes
    </Button>
  </Stack>
);
```

#### Cancel and save

Similar to revert and save, there is a difference in persistence and scope.
"Revert" often implies going back to a saved state, affecting changes made over
a longer period, while "Cancel" typically discards unsaved changes from the
current interaction.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
    <Button tone="primary" size="xs" variant="outline">
      Cancel
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="xs" variant="solid">
      Save
    </Button>
  </Stack>
);
```

#### Four icon buttons

Use up to four icons to allow your user to control the information within the
associated accordion.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
    <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.Edit />
    </IconButton>
    <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.PushPin />
    </IconButton>
    <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.FileCopy />
    </IconButton>
    <IconButton tone="critical" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.Delete />
    </IconButton>
  </Stack>
);
```

#### Delete

Single icon button, this is a common used control, used to delete the entire
accordion and content.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (
    <IconButton tone="critical" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.Delete />
    </IconButton>
  );
```

#### Switch

The use of switch often signals the effect of the settings being applied, or
activating the content within to be edited by the user.

![](/images/accordion/switch-button-with-label.png)

#### Select input

Allowing the users to select from a list. This control often controls the type
of form that will be shown for user completion.

```jsx-live

const App = () => (
  <Select.Root aria-label="Select an option" data-testid="select" selectedKey="1" >
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option id="1">Input value</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>
);
```

#### Custom controls

If these more typical controls do not suit the needs of your feature, create
controls that best suit your needs.

### Usage

Accordions are a versatile component that can effectively manage and present
information in a concise and organized way, improving usability and saving
screen space.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Lengthy content:** Use an accordion when you have a significant amount of
  content to display.
- **Logically grouped content:** Use an accordion when the content can be
  logically grouped under headings.
- **Limited vertical space:** Use an accordion when vertical space is limited.
- **Non-essential information:** Use an accordion when users don't need to see
  all the information at once.
- **Simplifying complex forms/settings:** Use an accordion when you want to
  simplify complex forms or settings.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Brief content:** Do not use an accordion when content is brief and easily
  fits on the screen. Hiding small amounts of information behind clicks is
  unnecessary.
- **Deeply nested content:** Do not use an accordion if the content is deeply
  nested. Multiple layers of accordions can become confusing and difficult to
  navigate.
- **Outgrowing component:** Do not use an accordion when controls and content
  are outgrowing the component. If the content becomes too complex, consider an
  alternative UI component.

#### Accordion nesting

Avoid nesting accordions because they hide information and make it hard for
users to predict the content of deeper nested components. Instead, create
simple, well-organized pages that use accordions to hold information in
meaningful ways for the user.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do organize the right information within accordions, if all closed, users
>   should be able to navigate information easily.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root size="sm">
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        General information
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>
        Product name
        <TextInput size="sm" value="Cozy coffee mug" w="100%"/>
        <br />
        product description
        <TextInput size="sm" value="A 15oz hand-thrown mug made by artisans." w="100%"/>
        <br />
        Product key
        <TextInput size="sm" value="Cozy-coffee-mug" w="100%"/>
      </Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not nest accordions excessively.
> - Do not use accordion controls when nested to reduce complexity.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root size="sm">
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        Product Details

          <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
            <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="sm">
              <Icons.Edit />
            </IconButton>
            <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="sm">
              <Icons.PushPin />
            </IconButton>
            <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="sm">
              <Icons.FileCopy />
            </IconButton>
            <IconButton tone="critical" variant="ghost" size="sm">

        </Accordion.Root>
      </Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

#### Accordion controls

Make it easy for users to understand what the attached controls do, and how to
interact with them when needed.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use tools that the user expects to use in the area to complete their tasks.
>   There should be no confusion on what the tools are for and what their
>   effects should be.
> - Include tooltips to describe icon buttons when used.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root size="sm">
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        General information
        <Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
        <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
            <Tooltip.Root>
              <Button tone="primary" size="xs" variant="outline">
                Cancel
              </Button>
              <Tooltip.Content>Cancel information changes</Tooltip.Content>
            </Tooltip.Root>
            <Tooltip.Root>
              <Button tone="primary" size="xs" variant="solid">
                Save
              </Button>
              <Tooltip.Content>Save general information changes</Tooltip.Content>
            </Tooltip.Root>
          </Stack>
        </Accordion.HeaderRightContent>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Content>
        Product name
        <TextInput size="sm" value="Cozy coffee mug" w="100%"/>
        <br />
        product description
        <TextInput size="sm" value="A 15oz hand-thrown mug made by artisans." w="100%"/>
        <br />
        Product key
        <TextInput size="sm" value="Cozy-coffee-mug" w="100%"/>
      </Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not add controls that have seemingly no reason to be there for the
>   majority of the users. If certain controls require permissions, consider
>   hiding them from certain users to simplify workspaces.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Accordion.Root size="sm">
    <Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Header>
        General information

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

### Accessibility standards

#### 1. Structure and semantics:

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships:** Use appropriate HTML elements to structure
  the accordion. Employ `<button>` for headers controlling panels. Use separate
  elements for content panels. Establish clear relationships between triggers
  and content programmatically.
- **Headings:** Utilize heading elements (`<h3>`, `<h2>`, etc.) for accordion
  headers. Provide semantic structure for navigation by assistive technologies.

#### 2. ARIA attributes:

- **ARIA Roles:** Apply `role="region"` to content panels for landmark
  identification.
- **aria-expanded:** Dynamically update on the \<button\> controlling the panel.
  `aria-expanded="true"` for visible panels. `aria-expanded="false"` for hidden
  panels.
- **aria-controls:** Set on the \<button\> to reference the id of its controlled
  content panel. Explicitly link the button to the content.
- **aria-labelledby:** Apply to the content panel (with `role="region"`).
  Reference the id of the accordion's header button.

#### 3. Keyboard navigation:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard:** Ensure full keyboard operability. Allow focus to reach
  each accordion header (`<button>`) using Tab. Enable toggling panel visibility
  using Space or Enter on focused headers. Consider arrow key navigation between
  headers (enhancement).

#### 4. Visibility and focus:

- **2.4.7 Focus Visible:** Provide a clear visual focus indicator for focused
  accordion headers (`<button>`). Assist keyboard users in identifying the
  selected element.

#### 5. Content visibility (for assistive technologies):

- **Ensure content of collapsed panels is:** Not focusable via keyboard. Hidden
  from screen readers (e.g., `aria-hidden="true"`, `display: none`).

#### 6. Color contrast:

- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):** Maintain sufficient color contrast for text
  within headers and content panels. Ensure readability against background
  colors.

#### 7. Clear indicators:

- Provide visual cues for expanded/collapsed states (e.g., arrows, +/-). Hide
  decorative indicators from screen readers (`aria-hidden="true"`).

#### 8. Avoidance of less accessible methods:

- Avoid relying solely on `<details>` and `<summary>` for complex accordions.
  ARIA attributes offer more reliable and controllable accessibility.
