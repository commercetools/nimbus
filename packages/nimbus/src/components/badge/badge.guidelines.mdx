## Guidelines

Badge guidelines ensure small, clear visual cues that highlight status or
metadata without overwhelming UI.

### Best practices

- **Be concise**: Keep badge labels short and to the point (ideally 1-2 words or
  a small number).
- **Use purposefully**: Only use badges to highlight truly important information
  or status; avoid overusing them.
- **Maintain visual hierarchy**: Ensure badges are visually less prominent than
  the elements they annotate.
- **Employ semantic colors**: Use established color palettes to consistently
  indicate meaning (e.g., green for success, red for error).
- **Place strategically**: Position badges consistently in relation to their
  associated elements for easy recognition.
- **Provide context**: If an icon-only badge is used, ensure a tooltip or
  surrounding context clarifies its meaning.

### Usage

Badges are small labels that highlight relevant metadata without overwhelming
the primary content, often using color and short text or icons to quickly convey
meaning. They are commonly found attached to navigation items, buttons, lists,
and avatars to draw attention to updates, counts, or specific attributes.

#### Should I use badges or tags?

- **Tags** display items of the same category, or basically a list of things
  just styled more aesthetically (e.g., countries). An item can display more
  than one tag at once as a group.
- **Badges** highlight the differences between the listed items (e.g., status:
  Published, Modified, Rejected) and benefit from semantic color ways to convey
  process or status. An item should only show one badge; if you want to show
  more than one, use a tag instead.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Use for concise information:** Keep badge text short (1-2 words) for quick
  readability.
- **Indicate status or category:** Clearly signal the state or classification of
  an associated element.
- **Maintain visual hierarchy:** Ensure badges are visually subordinate to the
  elements they modify.
- **Use color thoughtfully:** Employ color consistently to convey meaning (e.g.,
  green for positive, red for negative).
- **Ensure accessibility:** Provide sufficient color contrast meeting at least
  AA requirements, and use ARIA attributes for screen readers.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Don't overuse badges:** Reserve them for important highlights to avoid
  visual clutter.
- **Don't use as headers:** Employ proper typography for establishing hierarchy.
- **Don't use for lengthy feedback:** Use other UI elements for detailed
  messages.
- **Don't rely solely on color:** Supplement color with text or icons for
  accessibility.
- **Don't place them obstructively:** Ensure badges don't cover or interfere
  with primary content or interactions.

### Semantic colors

Use the established color palettes to consistently indicate meaning (if
applicable) when using badges.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - When communicating a success or positive state, use grass (green). For a
>   negative or critical state use tomato (red). If you need a warning state,
>   use yellow (amber). For default or neutral color options, use grey (slate),
>   blue, or purple (primary).

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="200">
    <Badge colorPalette="positive">Published</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="critical">Expired</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="warning">Modified</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="info">Trial version</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="primary">Premium</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="neutral">Disabled</Badge>
  </Stack>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't trick your users when the common pattern will be to have the meaning
>   and color together.
> - Do not use icons without label unless used with a tooltip label so users can
>   best understand the meaning of the badge.
> - Don't rely solely on color to relate a state. Pairing colors with an icon
>   and short descriptive label will be the best experience for accessibility
>   standards.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="200">
    <Badge colorPalette="positive">Unpublish</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="critical">Publish</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="warning">
      <Icons.Campaign />
    </Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="info">Expired</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="primary">
      <Icons.Delete /> Delete
    </Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="neutral">
      <Icons.FiberNew /> Updated
    </Badge>
  </Stack>
);
```

### Purposeful uses

Taking care not to overuse badges is important, they are great tools to help
users group or understand statuses, but overuse can be confusing and
overwhelming.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do use short and concise labels for badges, making sure not to overuse and
>   clutter the space for the user.
> - If using icons, pair the icon with a label or a tooltip so the user can
>   understand the meaning.
