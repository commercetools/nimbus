## Getting started

### Import

```tsx
import { Badge, type BadgeProps } from '@commercetools/nimbus';
```

### Basic usage

The simplest implementation uses the default size and color:

```jsx-live-dev
const App = () => (
  <Badge>Default Badge</Badge>
)
```

## Usage examples

### Size options

The `2xs`, `xs`, and `md` size variants are available to match your interface density:

```jsx-live-dev
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="400" alignItems="center">
    <Badge size="2xs">2xs Badge</Badge>
    <Badge size="xs">xs Badge</Badge>
    <Badge size="md">md Badge</Badge>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Visual variants

Badges support color palettes to convey semantic meaning or match a theme:

```jsx-live-dev
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="400">
    <Badge colorPalette="primary">Primary</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="positive">Positive</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="info">Info</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="critical">Critical</Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="cyan">Cyan</Badge>
  </Stack>
)
```

### With icons

Badges can contain icons alongside text for enhanced visual communication:

```jsx-live-dev
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="400">
    <Badge>
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Verified
    </Badge>
    <Badge colorPalette="critical">
      <Icons.Error />
      Error
    </Badge>
  </Stack>
)
```

## Component requirements

### Accessibility

The Badge component handles most accessibility requirements internally. However, you should ensure that the badge content is accessible.

- **Color Contrast**: The default color mappings (shade 3 for background, shade 11 for text) are designed to meet WCAG contrast requirements.
- **Screen Readers**: The badge text is read normally by screen readers. If the badge conveys status (like "Error"), ensure the text or a visually hidden label clarifies this context if it's not obvious from the surrounding content.

If your use case requires tracking and analytics for this component, it is good practice to add a **persistent**, **unique** id to the component:

```tsx
const PERSISTENT_ID = "example-badge";

export const Example = () => (
  <Badge id={PERSISTENT_ID}>Status</Badge>
);
```

#### Keyboard navigation

Badges are non-interactive elements and do not receive focus or support keyboard interaction.

## API reference

<PropsTable id="Badge" />

## Testing your implementation

These examples demonstrate how to test your implementation when using Badge within your application. As the component's internal functionality is already tested by Nimbus, these patterns help you verify your integration and application-specific logic.
