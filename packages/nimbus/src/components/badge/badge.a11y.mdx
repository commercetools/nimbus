Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Badge
    data-testid="status-badge"
    aria-label="Status: Active"
    colorPalette="primary"
  >
    <Icons.StarOutline />
    I am a badge
  </Badge>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- Always provide a meaningful label. If a visible label is not used, provide an
  aria-label for screen readers.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all elements (text and background).
- Avoid relying on color alone to convey information.
- Clearly indicate keyboard focus when interactive.
- Support keyboard navigation (e.g., `Tab`, `Space`, `Enter`).
- Manage text overflow (wrap text or truncate with a tooltip).
- Use descriptive `aria-describedby` if attached to an interactive element.
- Include a tooltip for icon-only badges.
