# Image

The `Image` component is used to display images. It's a proxy for the
[Chakra UI Image component](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/image) and
supports all its features, including fallback images and fit/sizing options.

## Import

```jsx
import { Image } from "@commercetools/nimbus";
```

## Usage

### Basic Image

To display an image, provide a `src`-image and an `alt`-text via their respective props.

By default the image will consume max. 100% of the available horizontal space
and adjust its height to maintain the image's aspect ratio.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Image src="https://i.imgur.com/fqpnfaN.png" alt="Nimbus - the spaceship from Futurama" />
);
```

### Sizing

If you need to set a fixed width and/or height, you can use the `width` and `height` props.
If you set both, the image will be cropped to fit the given dimensions. Other cropping strategies
are available via the `fit` prop.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Image src="https://i.imgur.com/fqpnfaN.png" alt="Nimbus - the spaceship from Futurama" width="256px" height="256px" />
);
```


### Fit + Position

Control how the image fits into its container using the `fit` prop and size props like `boxSize`, `width`, `height`.

#### Fit

- `fill` - This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit
- `contain` - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension
- `cover` - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit
- `none` - The image is not resized
- `scale-down` - the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain


```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" spacing="200">
   <Box>
    <Image
      boxSize="128px"
      fit="fill"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/fqpnfaN.png"
      alt="Filled image"
      outline="1px solid red"
    />
   </Box>
    <Image
      boxSize="128px"
      fit="contain"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/fqpnfaN.png"
      alt="Contained image"
      outline="1px solid red"
    />
    <Image
      boxSize="128px"
      fit="cover"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/fqpnfaN.png"
      alt="Covered image"
      outline="1px solid red"
    />
    
    <Image
      boxSize="128px"
      fit="none"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/fqpnfaN.png"
      alt="Filled image"
      outline="1px solid red"
    />
  </Stack>
);
```

### Border Radius

Apply a border radius using the `borderRadius` prop.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Image
    src="https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Rounded\nImage"
    alt="Round image"
    borderRadius="400"
  />
);
```

### Round Image

By combining the `borderRadius` prop with the `boxSize` prop, you can create a round image.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Image
    boxSize="6400"
    src="https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Round\nImage"
    alt="Round image"
    borderRadius="full"
  />
);
```
