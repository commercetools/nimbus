# Image

An image component is used to display visual content like photographs, illustrations, or graphics within the UI to support, illustrate, or enhance textual information.

## Overview

The image component offers core features designed for optimal performance, accessibility, and responsiveness when displaying visual content.

## Basic functions

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/image/image-sample.png"
    alt="Example image showing basic functionality"
    width="100%"
    maxWidth="9600"
  />
)
```

- **Source set (`srcSet`) and sizes:** This allows the component to define multiple image sources at different resolutions, enabling the browser to automatically select the most appropriate, performant image based on the user's viewport size.
- **Alternative text (`alt`):** It mandates the inclusion of descriptive alternative text, which is crucial for accessibility, ensuring screen readers convey the image's meaning.
- **Lazy loading:** The component supports native lazy loading, which delays the loading of images outside the user's viewport, significantly improving initial page load performance.
- **Loading behavior:** Allows control over the image loading strategy (e.g., eager vs. lazy) to prioritize critical visuals first seen.
- **Aspect ratio and fill:** The component can maintain a specific aspect ratio or fill its container, ensuring consistent sizing and preventing layout shift during loading.
- **Decoding:** It allows specification of the image decoding strategy (sync, async, or auto) to optimize rendering performance.

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/image/image-sample.png"
    alt="luxury metallic green handbag with floral handle. Mangosteen accessory hangs off the bag, and sitting on the table with the bag are small accessories, a pen, lipstick, and small notebook."
    width="4000"
  />
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Alt text is mandatory:** Every image must have an `alt` attribute. If the image is decorative, use a null/empty attribute (`alt=""`). If it conveys meaning, the alt text must be descriptive and functional.
- **Complex images:** For charts, graphs, or infographics, the text alternative must go beyond the title to describe the key information conveyed by the image.
- **Performance:** Optimize images to ensure they load quickly. Slow loading can significantly impair the experience for users on poor connections.
- **No conveyance of action:** If an image is a link or button, its text alternative must describe the action of the link/button, not just the image itself (e.g., `alt="View product details"`).
- **Contrast for text in images:** If the image contains critical text, ensure that the text meets WCAG contrast standards within the image itself.
