## Overview

The image component offers core features designed for optimal performance,
accessibility, and responsiveness when displaying visual content.

## Basic functions

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/image/image-sample.png"
    alt="Example image showing basic functionality"
    width="100%"
    maxWidth="9600"
  />
)
```

- **Source set (`srcSet`) and sizes:** This allows the component to define
  multiple image sources at different resolutions, enabling the browser to
  automatically select the most appropriate, performant image based on the
  user's viewport size.
- **Alternative text (`alt`):** It mandates the inclusion of descriptive
  alternative text, which is crucial for accessibility, ensuring screen readers
  convey the image's meaning.
- **Lazy loading:** The component supports native lazy loading, which delays the
  loading of images outside the user's viewport, significantly improving initial
  page load performance.
- **Loading behavior:** Allows control over the image loading strategy (e.g.,
  eager vs. lazy) to prioritize critical visuals first seen.
- **Aspect ratio and fill:** The component can maintain a specific aspect ratio
  or fill its container, ensuring consistent sizing and preventing layout shift
  during loading.
- **Decoding:** It allows specification of the image decoding strategy (sync,
  async, or auto) to optimize rendering performance.
