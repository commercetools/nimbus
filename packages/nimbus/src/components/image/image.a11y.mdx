Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/image/image-sample.png"
    alt="luxury metallic green handbag with floral handle. Mangosteen accessory hangs off the bag, and sitting on the table with the bag are small accessories, a pen, lipstick, and small notebook."
    width="4000"
  />
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Alt text is mandatory:** Every image must have an `alt` attribute. If the
  image is decorative, use a null/empty attribute (`alt=""`). If it conveys
  meaning, the alt text must be descriptive and functional.
- **Complex images:** For charts, graphs, or infographics, the text alternative
  must go beyond the title to describe the key information conveyed by the
  image.
- **Performance:** Optimize images to ensure they load quickly. Slow loading can
  significantly impair the experience for users on poor connections.
- **No conveyance of action:** If an image is a link or button, its text
  alternative must describe the action of the link/button, not just the image
  itself (e.g., `alt="View product details"`).
- **Contrast for text in images:** If the image contains critical text, ensure
  that the text meets WCAG contrast standards within the image itself.
