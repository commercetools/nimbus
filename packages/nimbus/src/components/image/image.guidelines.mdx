## Guidelines

Image guidelines establish best practices for the selection, display, and
optimization of visual content, ensuring accessibility, performance, and visual
consistency across all contexts. They govern image quality, responsive behavior,
appropriate usage of formats, and adherence to critical accessibility standards
like meaningful alt text.

### Best practices

- **Relevance:** Ensure the image directly supports or enhances the content it
  is paired with; avoid purely decorative or confusing visuals.
- **Quality and format:** Use high-quality, appropriately sized images.
  - **JPEG/WebP:** For photographs and complex images.
  - **PNG:** For images requiring transparency or simple graphics.
  - **SVG:** For logos, icons, and illustrations that need crisp scaling.
- **Responsiveness:** Implement responsive design principles so images scale
  correctly and maintain aspect ratios across various screen sizes without
  distorting or breaking the layout.
- **Performance optimization:** Compress images to minimize file size and ensure
  fast loading times. Implement lazy loading for images that appear below the
  fold.
- **Visual hierarchy:** Images should contribute to, but not dominate, the
  visual hierarchy unless they are the primary content (e.g., product hero
  image).
- **Maintain brand style:** Ensure all illustrations and graphics adhere to the
  established brand style and color palette.
