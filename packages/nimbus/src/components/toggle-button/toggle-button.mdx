# ToggleButton

An interactive button that toggles between two binary states such as active and
inactive.

## Overview

A toggle button is used similarly to a checkbox or a radio button, but supports
a smaller interactive component that can be used to give a binary active state
choice to users that can be used alone or in combination with other choices. A
toggle button or toggle icon button gives a user a new way of visualizing the
information in the interface. It does not typically perform an action. Please
use a button or an icon button for these uses.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visuals

#### Outlined

Most common styling of the toggle button.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButton variant="outline">
    <Icons.PushPin />
    Product categories
  </ToggleButton>
)
```

#### Ghost

Ghost styled buttons are helpful for UI simplification.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButton variant="ghost">
    <Icons.PushPin />
    Product categories
  </ToggleButton>
)
```

### Color palette

#### Primary (default)

The default colorPalette for most toggle buttons.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="400" align="center" direction="row">
    <ToggleButton>
      Primary
    </ToggleButton>
    <ToggleButton isSelected>
      Selected
    </ToggleButton>
  </Stack>
);
```

#### Neutral

Use for secondary or less prominent toggles.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="400" align="center" direction="row">
    <ToggleButton colorPalette="neutral">
      Neutral
    </ToggleButton>
    <ToggleButton colorPalette="neutral" isSelected>
      Selected
    </ToggleButton>
  </Stack>
);
```

#### Critical

Use for toggles that represent destructive or warning states.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="400" align="center" direction="row">
    <ToggleButton colorPalette="critical">
      Critical
    </ToggleButton>
    <ToggleButton colorPalette="critical" isSelected>
      Selected
    </ToggleButton>
  </Stack>
);
```

#### Info

Use for informational or help-related toggles.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="400" align="center" direction="row">
    <ToggleButton colorPalette="info">
      Info
    </ToggleButton>
    <ToggleButton colorPalette="info" isSelected>
      Selected
    </ToggleButton>
  </Stack>
);
```

## Guidelines

Toggle button guidelines aim to provide clear and consistent visual feedback to
users for compact binary states.

### Best practices

- **Provide clear labeling:** Always pair the toggle with a visible, persistent
  text label that describes the setting it controls.
- **Prioritize accessibility:** Use the appropriate aria-checked or aria-pressed
  attributes to convey the state to screen readers and ensure the component is
  fully keyboard navigable.
- **Ensure binary clarity:** Use single toggle buttons only for simple,
  two-state choices where the action is immediate and has a clear "on" or "off"
  status (e.g., Mute, Enable Dark Mode).

##### Toggle Groups (Segmented Controls)

- **Enforce mutual exclusivity:** Use toggle groups (segmented controls) when
  the user must select one option from a small, defined set (acting like radio
  buttons), such as viewing modes or alignment controls.
- **Ensure complementary actions:** Group only those actions or options that are
  closely related within the same context (e.g., filtering by "All," "Active,"
  "Completed").
- **Maintain consistent sizing:** All buttons within the group should be
  uniformly sized to create a cohesive, single-component look, even if the text
  labels vary slightly in length.
- **Limit options:** Keep the number of options within the group small (ideally
  3 to 5) to prevent overcrowding and confusion.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Binary settings:** When the control represents a simple, immediate choice
  between two mutually exclusive states (e.g., "On/Off," "Active/Inactive,"
  "Yes/No").
- **Instant application:** When the action takes effect immediately without
  requiring the user to press a separate "Save" or "Submit" button.
- **Configuration preferences:** For managing application settings or feature
  preferences (e.g., "Enable Notifications," "Use Dark Mode").
- **Visual status indicator:** When the current state of a persistent setting
  needs to be clearly visible at a glance.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Ambiguous actions:** Do not use them when the icon's meaning is unclear or
  requires the user to guess; use a text label.
- **Complex or multi-state processes:** Avoid using them for actions that
  require more than two states or sequential steps; use a segmented button or
  switch.
- **Critical, permanent actions:** Do not use them for destructive or major
  actions; use a full text button with confirmation.
- **Core navigation:** Avoid making primary navigation items toggleable unless
  they explicitly switch between two main views.
- **Multi-select options:** If the user can select multiple items from a list,
  use checkboxes instead.
- **Multi-state options:** If the user needs to select one option from three or
  more choices, use radio buttons or a segmented control instead.
- **Actions requiring confirmation:** Do not use for actions that are
  destructive, irreversible, or require confirmation (e.g., deleting an account,
  submitting a payment). Use a standard button that triggers a confirmation
  dialog.
- **Complex settings:** Avoid using a toggle if the result of the action isn't
  clear or if the setting requires additional input fields to be configured.
- **Triggers for new pages:** Do not use a toggle to navigate to a new section
  or page; use a link or standard button for navigation.
- **Long-running processes:** For actions that take time to complete (e.g.,
  "Start Backup"), a standard button that displays a loading spinner upon press
  is more appropriate.

### Toggle buttons in use

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do use toggle buttons for a simple binary choice (on/off).
> - Do place them in toolbars or areas where space is limited.
> - Do ensure the "on" state is clearly distinct from the "off" state.
> - Do connect buttons that toggle one active state among a small selection of
>   options.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButton>
    <Icons.LocalShipping />
    Default shipping address
  </ToggleButton>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't use for destructive or critical actions needing confirmation.
> - Don't use for navigation.
> - Don't rely on subtle color changes alone to show the state.
> - Don't use for complex settings that require additional user input.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButton>
    <Icons.Delete />
    Delete all of my data
  </ToggleButton>
)
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButton>
    <Icons.PushPin />
    Product categories
  </ToggleButton>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Use aria-pressed:** The most crucial accessibility attribute for a toggle
  button is `aria-pressed`. When the button is "on," set `aria-pressed="true"`.
  When it's "off," set `aria-pressed="false"`. This tells screen readers that
  the button's function is to toggle.
- **Provide a Clear aria-label:** Since the button lacks visible text, provide a
  descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., `aria-label="Toggle Bold"` or
  `aria-label="Show Advanced Settings"`). This is what a screen reader will
  announce to the user.
- **Ensure Keyboard Operability:** Users must be able to navigate to the button
  using the Tab key and toggle its state using the Enter or Spacebar keys.
