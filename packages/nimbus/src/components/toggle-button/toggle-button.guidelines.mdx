## Guidelines

Toggle button guidelines aim to provide clear and consistent visual feedback to
users for compact binary states.

### Best practices

- **Provide clear labeling:** Always pair the toggle with a visible, persistent
  text label that describes the setting it controls.
- **Prioritize accessibility:** Use the appropriate aria-checked or aria-pressed
  attributes to convey the state to screen readers and ensure the component is
  fully keyboard navigable.
- **Ensure binary clarity:** Use single toggle buttons only for simple,
  two-state choices where the action is immediate and has a clear "on" or "off"
  status (e.g., Mute, Enable Dark Mode).

##### Toggle Groups (Segmented Controls)

- **Enforce mutual exclusivity:** Use toggle groups (segmented controls) when
  the user must select one option from a small, defined set (acting like radio
  buttons), such as viewing modes or alignment controls.
- **Ensure complementary actions:** Group only those actions or options that are
  closely related within the same context (e.g., filtering by "All," "Active,"
  "Completed").
- **Maintain consistent sizing:** All buttons within the group should be
  uniformly sized to create a cohesive, single-component look, even if the text
  labels vary slightly in length.
- **Limit options:** Keep the number of options within the group small (ideally
  3 to 5) to prevent overcrowding and confusion.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Binary settings:** When the control represents a simple, immediate choice
  between two mutually exclusive states (e.g., "On/Off," "Active/Inactive,"
  "Yes/No").
- **Instant application:** When the action takes effect immediately without
  requiring the user to press a separate "Save" or "Submit" button.
- **Configuration preferences:** For managing application settings or feature
  preferences (e.g., "Enable Notifications," "Use Dark Mode").
- **Visual status indicator:** When the current state of a persistent setting
  needs to be clearly visible at a glance.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Ambiguous actions:** Do not use them when the icon's meaning is unclear or
  requires the user to guess; use a text label.
- **Complex or multi-state processes:** Avoid using them for actions that
  require more than two states or sequential steps; use a segmented button or
  switch.
- **Critical, permanent actions:** Do not use them for destructive or major
  actions; use a full text button with confirmation.
- **Core navigation:** Avoid making primary navigation items toggleable unless
  they explicitly switch between two main views.
- **Multi-select options:** If the user can select multiple items from a list,
  use checkboxes instead.
- **Multi-state options:** If the user needs to select one option from three or
  more choices, use radio buttons or a segmented control instead.
- **Actions requiring confirmation:** Do not use for actions that are
  destructive, irreversible, or require confirmation (e.g., deleting an account,
  submitting a payment). Use a standard button that triggers a confirmation
  dialog.
- **Complex settings:** Avoid using a toggle if the result of the action isn't
  clear or if the setting requires additional input fields to be configured.
- **Triggers for new pages:** Do not use a toggle to navigate to a new section
  or page; use a link or standard button for navigation.
- **Long-running processes:** For actions that take time to complete (e.g.,
  "Start Backup"), a standard button that displays a loading spinner upon press
  is more appropriate.

### Toggle buttons in use

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do use toggle buttons for a simple binary choice (on/off).
> - Do place them in toolbars or areas where space is limited.
> - Do ensure the "on" state is clearly distinct from the "off" state.
> - Do connect buttons that toggle one active state among a small selection of
>   options.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButton>
    <Icons.LocalShipping />
    Default shipping address
  </ToggleButton>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't use for destructive or critical actions needing confirmation.
> - Don't use for navigation.
> - Don't rely on subtle color changes alone to show the state.
> - Don't use for complex settings that require additional user input.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButton>
    <Icons.Delete />
    Delete all of my data
  </ToggleButton>
)
```
