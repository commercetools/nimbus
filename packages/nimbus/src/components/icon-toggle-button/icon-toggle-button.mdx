# Icon Toggle Button

An interactive icon button that toggles between two binary states such as active
and inactive.

## Overview

An icon toggle button is used similarly to a checkbox or a radio button, but
supports a smaller interactive component that can be used to give a binary
active state choice to users that can be used alone or in combination with other
choices. A toggle button or icon toggle button gives a user a new way of
visualizing the information in the interface. It does not typically perform an
action. Please use a button or an icon button for these uses.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visuals

#### Outlined

Most common styling of the icon toggle button.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <IconToggleButton variant="outline" aria-label="Pin item">
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
  </IconToggleButton>
)
```

#### Ghost

Ghost styled buttons are helpful for UI simplification.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <IconToggleButton variant="ghost" aria-label="Pin item">
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
  </IconToggleButton>
)
```

### Size

There are three sizes to icon toggle buttons, the default size is medium (md),
extra small (xs), and 2x-small (2xs).

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="400">
    <IconToggleButton size="md" aria-label="Pin favorite">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
    </IconToggleButton>
    <IconToggleButton size="xs" aria-label="Pin favorite">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
    </IconToggleButton>
    <IconToggleButton size="2xs" aria-label="Pin favorite">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
    </IconToggleButton>
  </Stack>
)
```

## Guidelines

Icon toggle button guidelines aim to provide clear and consistent visual
feedback to users for compact binary states.

### Best practices

- **Avoid setting a default toggle as active:** Instead, let users choose their
  preference. If one option is selected more frequently, make it the default,
  while still allowing users to switch to the less popular choice.
- **Intuitive icons:** Use icons that are universally recognized for the action
  they represent. Consider adding a tooltip on hover to provide a text label to
  help a user understand what is being chosen.
- **Maintain visual consistency:** The icon's style (line weight, color, fill)
  should be consistent with the rest of the icons in the design system to ensure
  a cohesive look and feel.
- **Provide immediate feedback:** The button should visually respond instantly
  when a user clicks or taps it, providing reassurance that the action was
  successful.
- **Communicate meaningful changes:** If a toggle button makes a significant
  change (ex: updating default payment) pair this toggled action with a toast
  message to better communicate the change when needed.

##### Toggle Groups (Segmented Controls)

- **Enforce mutual exclusivity:** Use toggle groups (segmented controls) when
  the user must select only one option from a small, defined set, similar to
  radio button behavior (e.g., alignment controls, viewing modes).
- **Limit options:** Keep the number of options within a group small (ideally 3
  to 5) to prevent overcrowding and ensure each button is easily tappable.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Compact binary states:** Use them for on/off settings in toolbars or
  space-limited areas (e.g., toggling bold text, muting).
- **Clear, universal actions:** Use them for actions whose icon is immediately
  understood without a text label (e.g., Pin, Star).
- **Quick filtering:** Use them for providing quick, visual controls for
  filtering items or selecting a mode.
- **Frequent interactions:** Use them when an action is performed often to save
  time and screen space.
- **Instant application:** When the action takes effect immediately without
  requiring the user to press a separate "Save" or "Submit" button.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Ambiguous actions:** Do not use them when the icon's meaning is unclear or
  requires the user to guess; use a text label or tooltip.
- **Complex or multi-state processes:** Avoid using them for actions that
  require more than two states or sequential steps; use a segmented button or
  switch.
- **Critical, permanent actions:** Do not use them for destructive or major
  actions; use a full text button with confirmation.
- **Core navigation:** Avoid making primary navigation items toggle-able unless
  they explicitly switch between two main views.
- **Multi-select options:** If the user can select multiple items from a list,
  use checkboxes instead.
- **Multi-state options:** If the user needs to select one option from three or
  more choices, use radio buttons or a segmented control instead.
- **Actions requiring confirmation:** Do not use for actions that are
  destructive, irreversible, or require confirmation (e.g., deleting an account,
  submitting a payment). Use a standard button that triggers a confirmation
  dialog.
- **Complex settings:** Avoid using a toggle if the result of the action isn't
  clear or if the setting requires additional input fields to be configured.
- **Triggers for new pages:** Do not use a toggle to navigate to a new section
  or page; use a link or standard button for navigation.
- **Long-running processes:** For actions that take time to complete (e.g.,
  "Start Backup"), a standard button that displays a loading spinner upon press
  is more appropriate.

### Icon toggle buttons in use

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do use icon toggle buttons for a simple binary choice (on/off).
> - Do place them in toolbars or areas where space is limited.
> - Do ensure the "on" state is clearly distinct from the "off" state.
> - Do connect buttons that toggle one active state among a small selection of
>   options.

![Do](/images/icon-toggle-button/icon-toggle-button-do.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't use them for multi-step processes or complex selections.
> - Don't use an ambiguous icon without a tooltip or a text label.
> - Don't use an icon toggle button, when you should use an icon button instead.

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <IconToggleButton aria-label="Toggle favorite">
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
  </IconToggleButton>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Use aria-pressed:** The most crucial accessibility attribute for a icon
  toggle button is `aria-pressed`. When the button is "on," set
  `aria-pressed="true"`. When it's "off," set `aria-pressed="false"`. This tells
  screen readers that the button's function is to toggle.
- **Provide a Clear aria-label:** Since the button lacks visible text, provide a
  descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., `aria-label="Toggle Bold"` or
  `aria-label="Show Advanced Settings"`). This is what a screen reader will
  announce to the user.
- **Ensure Keyboard Operability:** Users must be able to navigate to the button
  using the Tab key and toggle its state using the Enter or Spacebar keys.
