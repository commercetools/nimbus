## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <IconToggleButton aria-label="Toggle favorite">
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
  </IconToggleButton>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Use aria-pressed:** The most crucial accessibility attribute for a icon
  toggle button is `aria-pressed`. When the button is "on," set
  `aria-pressed="true"`. When it's "off," set `aria-pressed="false"`. This tells
  screen readers that the button's function is to toggle.
- **Provide a Clear aria-label:** Since the button lacks visible text, provide a
  descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., `aria-label="Toggle Bold"` or
  `aria-label="Show Advanced Settings"`). This is what a screen reader will
  announce to the user.
- **Ensure Keyboard Operability:** Users must be able to navigate to the button
  using the Tab key and toggle its state using the Enter or Spacebar keys.
