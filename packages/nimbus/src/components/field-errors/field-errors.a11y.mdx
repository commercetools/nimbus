Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <FieldErrors
    errors={{ critical: true }}
    isVisible={true}
    renderError={(key) => {
      if (key === "critical") {
        return "Provide your name to continue.";
      }
      return null;
    }}
  />
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Instant announcement:** The root container uses `role="alert"` to trigger
  screen readers to immediately announce error messages when they become
  visible, providing critical, instant feedback to the user.
- **WCAG contrast:** The default critical color palette provides sufficient
  contrast for the error text to meet WCAG AA standards. This must be maintained
  when using custom colors.
- **Actionable messaging:** Error messages should use clear, plain language that
  focuses on what the user needs to do to fix the problem, not just what went
  wrong (e.g., "Password must be at least 8 characters" instead of "Length
  validation failed").
- **Association:** When integrated with the FormField component, errors are
  automatically associated with their input fields via ARIA, helping screen
  readers clearly link the error message to the field that caused it.
- **Color is supplemental:** Color (red tones) is used as a supplemental
  indicator; the text content itself provides the error information, meeting
  WCAG requirements for users with color vision deficiencies.
- **Visibility control:** Always tie `isVisible` to the field's interaction
  state (touched or blurred) to prevent users from hearing confusing
  announcements before they've had a chance to input data.
