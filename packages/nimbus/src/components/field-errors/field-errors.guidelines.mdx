## Guidelines

Field error guidelines establish how validation issues are communicated to the user, ensuring messages are clear, concise, actionable, and visually presented with appropriate urgency and accessibility features.


### Best practices
- **Validate inline and on blur:** Only show error messages after the user has finished interacting with the field (i.e., when they click or tab out). Showing errors while the user is typing is highly distracting.
- **Be specific and actionable:** Tell the user what went wrong and how to fix it, not just that the input is invalid.
- **Be concise:** Keep error messages short and easy to read quickly. If the fix is simple, the message should be too.
- **Avoid technical jargon:** Use plain, user-friendly language. Avoid referencing internal system terms or validation rules (like "Regex failure" or "API 404").
- **Group and prioritize:** When showing multiple errors, group them logically and ensure the most critical or blocking error is listed first.
- **Use clear visual cues:** Use the critical/red color palette for the border, text, and an accompanying error icon to draw immediate attention.
- **Place errors contextually:** Position the error message directly below the input field it refers to. This maintains a strong visual association and reading flow.
- **Minimize layout shift:** Design the error message container so that when the message appears, it doesn't cause the rest of the form elements below it to jump or shift excessively.
- **Distinguish severity:** Use Warning/Orange tones for non-blocking issues or cautionary alerts, reserving Critical/Red for errors that truly prevent submission.

### Tone of voice
 - **Avoid using "please":** When the UI is requesting information (e.g., "Enter your password") or enforcing a rule (e.g., "Password must be 8 characters long"), the language should be direct and authoritative. Using "please" can sometimes weaken the instructional tone, making the requirement seem optional or negotiable.
   - **Localization formality:** If you use "please" inconsistently, it can confuse users. Furthermore, translating polite phrases across languages can be complex and sometimes lead to awkward or overly formal phrasing in the localized UI.
 - **Stay neutral:** Maintain a helpful, professional, and consistent tone across all error types. Avoid attempting to be overly clever or humorous, as this can be misunderstood during a stressful moment.
 - **Avoid blame:** Never use accusatory language (e.g., "You failed," "You must"). Use neutral, system-focused language.
 - **Use softening words (sparingly):** Use words like "sorry" appropriately to soften the message, especially for critical errors. Example: "Sorry, that rank order is already taken. Please try another." Do not overuse softening language. A direct, informative tone is typically perceived as more professional and helpful than an overly conversational one in task-focused areas.


### Usage
Field error messages are used to communicate validation failures immediately after a user's unsuccessful input attempt, providing specific, actionable guidance on how to correct the mistake.



> [!TIP]\
> When to use
- **Validation fails on blur/touch:** Use an error message immediately after the user attempts to interact with the field (clicks in and clicks out) and the input fails validation (e.g., they leave a required field empty).
- **Preventing form submission:** Use an error message to clearly indicate which fields must be corrected before the form can be successfully submitted.
- **Providing actionable correction:** Use the message to tell the user exactly how to fix the problem (e.g., "Password must contain one number" or "Please enter 8 or more characters").
- **After server rejection:** Use an error message to display a concise message from the server indicating why the submitted value was rejected (e.g., "That email address is already registered").


> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use
- **When the form first loads:** Do not show "This field is required" error messages on empty fields when the form initially loads. This is highly distracting and premature.
- **While the user is typing:** Avoid showing a hard error message (like a red border and critical text) while the user is actively typing; it is interruptive. Use subtle positive feedback (like a green checkmark) for successful input instead.
- **For simple hints:** Do not use an error message container for basic formatting hints or guidelines; use neutral helper text for these non-critical purposes.
- **For non-blocking issues:** Avoid using the critical (red) error visual treatment for issues that won't actually prevent the form from submitting. Use a softer warning or info tone instead.
- **When using a different component:** Do not attach field errors to components that don't accept direct user text input (like a toggle switch or a button group), as the interaction models are different.

### Do’s and dont’s for error state messages 

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Write concisely in plain language, avoiding technical jargon, error codes, or ambiguous terms.
> - Position the error message directly next to the field it pertains to, and highlight the source of the problem.
> - Show the error message immediately after the user interacts with the field or attempts to submit the form.
> - Clearing the error message and the visual cues as soon as the user corrects the input.
> - If known, provide suggestions or links to helpful resources (e.g., a "Forgot Password?" link).

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <FormField.Root isInvalid >
    <FormField.Label>Name</FormField.Label>
    <FormField.Input>
      <TextInput />
    </FormField.Input>
    <FormField.Error>
      <FieldErrors
        errors={{ missing: true }}
        isVisible={true}
      />
    </FormField.Error>
  </FormField.Root>
);
```



> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Avoid harsh, accusatory, or negative language.
> - Never use technical terms or obscure codes.
> - Avoid generic messages like "Something went wrong" or "Error."
> - Don't display "Required" field errors when the form first loads, as this creates user fatigue.
> - Keep the error message inline and contextual.
> - Avoid giving away hints that could aid malicious users (e.g., don't confirm if a username or email is not registered).


```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="200">
    <FormField.Root isInvalid>
      <FormField.Label>Name</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <TextInput width="9600" />
      </FormField.Input>
    </FormField.Root>
    <FieldErrors
      errors={{ missing: true }}
      isVisible={true}
      renderError={(key) => {
        if (key === "missing") {
          return (
            <Flex gap="100" alignItems="center">
              <Icon color="critical.11" boxSize="600">
                <Icons.ErrorOutline />
              </Icon>
              You put in the wrong details. Correct without invalidating this form to continue. We are very disappointed in your interactions here and one more mistake we will send a message automatically to your admin.
