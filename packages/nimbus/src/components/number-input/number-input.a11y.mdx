## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <NumberInput
    defaultValue={10}
    aria-label="Quantity"
    min={1}
    max={100}
    step={1}
  />
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- Always provide a visible label for the input.
- If a visible label is not used, provide an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`
  for screen readers.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all elements (text, borders, icons).
- Communicate errors clearly, using both visual cues (e.g., color) and
  descriptive error messages.
- Clearly indicate the focused state.
- Support keyboard navigation with arrow keys, scroll wheel, and modifier keys.
- Provide clear feedback for value changes and constraints.
