## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <InlineSvg
    svgContent='<svg viewBox="0 0 24 24"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10" fill="currentColor" /></svg>'
  />
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Decorative SVGs:** The SVG is rendered with `role="presentation"` by default
  as it's intended for decorative use. This hides the SVG from screen readers.
- **Accessible SVGs:** If you need accessible SVGs, include `<title>` and
  `<desc>` elements directly in your SVG markup - they will be preserved during
  sanitization.
- **Avoid conveying meaning through decorative images:** Don't rely on
  decorative SVGs to communicate important information.
- **Provide text alternatives:** Ensure important information is available
  through text content, not just visual elements.
