The SVG is rendered with `role="presentation"` as it's intended for decorative
use. If you need accessible SVGs, include `<title>` and `<desc>` elements
directly in your SVG markup - they will be preserved during sanitization.

## Security considerations

The component provides comprehensive XSS protection:

### What gets removed

- All JavaScript execution vectors (`<script>`, event handlers)
- Style injection attempts (`<style>` tags, style attributes)
- Dangerous protocols in URLs (`javascript:`, `data:`, etc.)
- Potentially dangerous elements (`<iframe>`, `<embed>`, etc.)

### What gets preserved

- SVG structure elements (`<g>`, `<path>`, `<circle>`, etc.)
- Visual attributes (fill, stroke, transform, etc.)
- Accessibility elements (`<title>`, `<desc>`)
- Safe URLs (http:, https:, relative paths, fragments)
