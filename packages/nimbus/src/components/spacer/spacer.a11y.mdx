## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" width="full">
    <Button variant="solid">Left</Button>
    <Spacer />
    <Button variant="outline">Right</Button>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Semantic Structure**: Spacer should not affect document semantics or screen
  reader navigation
- **Visual Only**: The spacing created by Spacer is purely visual and should not
  convey meaning
- **Alternative Approaches**: If spacing conveys important information, consider
  using semantic HTML elements with appropriate ARIA attributes
