## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live-dev
const App = () => (
  <ProgressBar value={40} label="Loading..." />
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Use ARIA attributes:** Use `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, and
  `aria-valuemax` to specify the current value, minimum value, and maximum value
  of a determinate progress bar.
- **Provide an accessible label:** Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to give
  the progress bar a descriptive name.
- **Announce changes:** Use aria-live regions to announce changes in progress to
  screen reader users.
- **Provide clear status:** Use text to indicate the current state (e.g.,
  'uploading', 'complete') for users who cannot see the visual component.
- **Do not rely on color alone:** Use icons or text labels to indicate status,
  such as an error state, for users with color vision deficiency.
