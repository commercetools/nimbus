# ProgressBar

A linear visual indicator that displays the loading or completion state of an
ongoing process. It can represent either determinate or indeterminate progress.

## Overview

A progress bar's primary usage is to visually communicate to the user that a
process is ongoing. If used in combination with a flow or tasks, a progress bar
can give a visual indicator of where they currently are in the process and
estimate how much is left to complete the task.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visuals

#### On white background

Most common, progress bar is used on white backgrounds.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ProgressBar
    value={50}
    label=""
    colorPalette="primary"
  />
)
```

#### On dark background

If being used on a dark background, use the contrast variant.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Box bg="neutral.9" p="600">
    <ProgressBar
      value={50}
      label=""
      variant="contrast"
      colorPalette="primary"
    />
  </Box>
)
```

### Size

There are two sizes to progress bar: the default size is medium (md) and
2x-small (2xs).

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="50" alignItems="stretch">
    <ProgressBar
      value={75}
      label=""
      size="2xs"
      colorPalette="primary"
    />
    <ProgressBar
      value={75}
      label=""
      size="md"
      colorPalette="primary"
    />
  </Stack>
)
```

### Layouts

Customizable layouts for different use cases, and to fit the UI best.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="200" alignItems="stretch">
    <ProgressBar
      value={50}
      label="Stacked label"
      layout="stacked"
      colorPalette="primary"
    />
    <ProgressBar
      value={50}
      label="Inline label"
      layout="inline"
      colorPalette="primary"
    />
  </Stack>
)
```

### Animation logic

Two options for loading animations based on timing.

#### Dynamic

A determinate progress bar indicates a specific percentage of completion. This
is useful when the total time or size of a task is known. For dynamic loading,
the color gradient is animated.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0);
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = React.useState(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!isRunning) return;

    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setValue((prev) => {
        if (prev >= 100) {
          setIsRunning(false);
          return 100;
        }
        return prev + 10;
      });
    }, 500);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [isRunning]);

  const handleStart = () => {
    setValue(0);
    setIsRunning(true);
  };

  return (
    <Stack direction="column" gap="400" alignItems="stretch">
      <ProgressBar
        value={value}
        label="Loading..."
        colorPalette="primary"
      />
      <Button
        onClick={handleStart}
        isDisabled={isRunning}
        width="fit-content"
        colorPalette="primary"
        variant="solid"
      >
        Start
      </Button>
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

#### Static

A static loading bar allows a viewer to know where they are currently in the
process. Static progress bars do not have an animated color gradient.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [currentLesson, setCurrentLesson] = React.useState(5);
  const totalLessons = 10;
  const progress = (currentLesson / totalLessons) * 100;

  const handleNextLesson = () => {
    if (currentLesson < totalLessons) {
      setCurrentLesson(prev => prev + 1);
    }
  };

  return (
    <Stack direction="column" gap="400" alignItems="stretch">
      <ProgressBar
        value={progress}
        label="Lessons completed"
        colorPalette="primary"
      />
      <Button
        variant="outline"
        width="fit-content"
        onClick={handleNextLesson}
        isDisabled={currentLesson >= totalLessons}
      >
        Next lesson
      </Button>
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

#### Indeterminate

An indeterminate progress bar shows that an operation is in progress without
indicating how much of it is complete. This is useful for tasks with an unknown
duration.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ProgressBar
    isIndeterminate={true}
    label="Uploading your files..."
    colorPalette="primary"
  />
)
```

## Guidelines

Progress bar guidelines aim to provide clear and consistent visual feedback to
users during processing delays, ensuring they understand the system is active
and preventing frustration by indicating that they need to wait.

### Best practices

- **Communicate the process:** Always provide a clear label describing the
  process the progress bar is tracking, like 'uploading file' or 'submitting
  form'.
- **Show progress with numbers:** Include a percentage or a fraction (e.g., 50%
  or 10/20) to give users a precise understanding of the progress.
- **Provide feedback on status:** Use text to indicate the current state, such
  as 'uploading,' 'complete,' or 'error.'
- **Keep it moving:** The progress bar should not stop or go backward. If a task
  is paused, the bar should also pause, and the label should reflect the new
  status.
- **Use the right type:** Use a determinate bar for tasks with a known end
  point. Use an indeterminate bar for tasks with an unknown duration.
- **Be accessible:** Ensure the progress bar is accessible to screen readers by
  using proper ARIA attributes like `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`,
  `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-label`.

### Usage

Progress bars communicate the status of ongoing operations to users, reducing
uncertainty and improving perceived performance.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **When a process takes a few seconds or longer:** A progress bar is useful for
  tasks that are not instantaneous. For short delays, a spinner or loading
  skeleton may be more appropriate.
- **When the progress of a task can be quantified:** A progress bar is best for
  tasks with a known beginning and end, where a percentage or specific value can
  be tracked.
- **To manage user expectations:** When users know a process is underway and can
  see its progress, it reduces anxiety and provides a sense of control.
- **To provide a visual indicator of progress:** A progress bar is a clear
  visual cue that something is happening in the background, preventing users
  from thinking the application has frozen or crashed.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **For instantaneous tasks:** Do not use a progress bar for a task that takes
  less than a second to complete. The visual appearance and disappearance of the
  bar can be distracting.
- **When the process cannot be measured:** Avoid using a determinate progress
  bar if the total time or progress is unknown. This can lead to misleading
  information and a poor user experience. An indeterminate progress bar or a
  spinner is a better choice in this case.
- **When providing an indefinite loading state:** For a task with an unknown or
  infinite duration, use a spinner to indicate that a process is running without
  implying a specific completion time.

### Progress bar uses

Be clear when using progress bar within the interface. It is important to let
the user know what is happening within working processes.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do use a determinate progress bar when the total time or size is known. This
>   provides a clear sense of progress and completion.
> - Do provide a label for context. Labels help users understand what the
>   progress bar represents.
> - Do use a progress bar for user-initiated tasks. It gives the user a sense of
>   control and feedback on their actions.
> - Do ensure the progress bar is responsive. It should adapt to different
>   screen sizes without distorting the design.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [indexingKey, setIndexingKey] = React.useState(0);
  const [progress, setProgress] = React.useState(0);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (indexingKey === 0) return;

    setProgress(0);
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setProgress((prev) => {
        if (prev >= 100) {
          clearInterval(interval);
          return 100;
        }
        return prev + 5;
      });
    }, 300);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [indexingKey]);

  const handleIndexClick = () => {
    setIndexingKey((prev) => prev + 1);
  };

  return (
    <Stack direction="column" gap="400" alignItems="stretch">
      <Alert.Root tone="info" variant="outlined">
        <Alert.Description>
          Indexing your project catalog. You can keep using the Merchant Center in the meantime but your changes will be applied only after the process has finished. We will notify you once we are done.
        </Alert.Description>
      </Alert.Root>
      {indexingKey > 0 && (
        <ProgressBar
          value={progress}
          label="Indexing projects..."
          colorPalette="primary"
        />
      )}
      <Button
        variant="solid"
        colorPalette="primary"
        width="fit-content"
        onClick={handleIndexClick}
      >
        Index the project catalog
      </Button>
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't use a determinate progress bar for tasks with an unknown duration. Use
>   an indeterminate bar instead to avoid misleading the user.
> - Don't show a progress bar without providing the context needed to understand
>   what is being loaded.
> - Don't use multiple progress bars for a single task. One bar should be
>   sufficient to represent the overall progress.
> - Don't show erratic animation with a progress bar, simplify tasks so that it
>   can be estimated in a single bar or use an indeterminate animation instead.
> - Don't use a progress bar for system-initiated background tasks. These tasks
>   should be handled without user intervention or visible indicators.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = React.useState(false);
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!isRunning) return;

    setValue(0);
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setValue((prev) => {
        // Simulate erratic progress
        const change = Math.random() > 0.5 ? 15 : -10;
        const newValue = prev + change;
        if (newValue > 100) return 100;
        if (newValue < 0) return 0;
        return newValue;
      });
    }, 800);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [isRunning]);

  const handleStart = () => {
    setValue(0);
    setIsRunning(true);
  };

  return (

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

### Accessibility standards

- **Use ARIA attributes:** Use `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, and
  `aria-valuemax` to specify the current value, minimum value, and maximum value
  of a determinate progress bar.
- **Provide an accessible label:** Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to give
  the progress bar a descriptive name.
- **Announce changes:** Use aria-live regions to announce changes in progress to
  screen reader users.
- **Provide clear status:** Use text to indicate the current state (e.g.,
  'uploading', 'complete') for users who cannot see the visual component.
- **Do not rely on color alone:** Use icons or text labels to indicate status,
  such as an error state, for users with color vision deficiency.
