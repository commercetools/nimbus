A pre-composed, "happy path" component that wraps FormField and TextInput to provide a simple, flat API for common use cases.
Allows users to enter information like names, addresses, emails, passwords, search queries, or any other text-based data.

## Overview

Users can type, delete, copy, and paste text within the box. Sometimes there can be additional features like autocomplete or validation to help users enter information correctly.
