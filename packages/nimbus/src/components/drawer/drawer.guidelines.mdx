## Guidelines

Use drawers strategically to enhance user workflow without disrupting the
experience.

### Best practices

- **Use drawers sparingly**: Only when you need to interrupt the user's flow for
  critical actions
- **Keep content focused**: Drawers should have a single, clear purpose
- **Provide clear actions**: Always include obvious ways to proceed or dismiss
- **Make dismissal easy**: Support Escape key, close buttons, and click-outside
  behavior. For forms with unsaved changes, use `shouldDelayOnClose` to intercept
  close attempts and show a confirmation before discarding data
- **Maintain focus flow**: Focus should move logically through interactive
  elements
- **Size appropriately**: Choose sizes that fit your content without
  overwhelming the viewport. For complex full-page editing workflows, use the
  ModalPage component instead
- **Consider mobile**: Ensure drawers work well on small screens

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Confirming destructive actions**: Delete confirmations and critical warnings
- **Collecting focused input**: Forms, settings, and data entry that requires
  attention
- **Displaying critical alerts**: Important information that requires immediate
  user attention
- **Showing detailed information**: Content that doesn't require navigation to a
  new page
- **Authentication flows**: Login, signup, and security-related interactions

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Complex multi-step workflows**: Use pages instead for lengthy processes
- **Non-critical information**: Use inline content for supplementary information
- **Navigation**: Use proper routing instead of drawers for moving between
  sections
- **Content that needs to be referenced**: Avoid for information users need
  while working elsewhere
