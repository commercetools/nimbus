### Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [leftItems, setLeftItems] = useState([
    { key: "1", label: "Food" },
    { key: "2", label: "Cosmetics" },
    { key: "3", label: "Furniture" },
    { key: "4", label: "Electronics" },
    { key: "5", label: "Clothing" },
  ]);

  const [rightItems, setRightItems] = useState([
    { key: "6", label: "Sport" },
    { key: "7", label: "Home" },
  ]);

  return (
    <Flex gap="400">
      <DraggableList.Root
        aria-label="Left column"
        items={leftItems}
        onUpdateItems={setLeftItems}
      />
      <DraggableList.Root
        aria-label="Right column"
        items={rightItems}
        onUpdateItems={setRightItems}
      />
    </Flex>
  );
}
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Keyboard reordering is essential:** Since drag-and-drop is a complex pointer
  gesture, a keyboard-accessible method for reordering is mandatory (WCAG 2.5.1
  Pointer Gestures). This usually involves providing "Move Up" and "Move Down"
  buttons or a position input field next to the list item.
- **ARIA roles:** Use appropriate ARIA roles to convey the list and item
  structure to screen readers. For interactive lists, `role="listbox"` for the
  container and `role="option"` for items might be suitable, or use standard
  semantic lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`) enhanced with ARIA attributes.
- **Focus management:** Ensure the drag handle or the dedicated keyboard buttons
  are included in the Tab order and have clear focus indicators.
- **Status updates:** Announce the result of the reordering to screen reader
  users using an `aria-live` region (e.g., "Item moved to position 4").
