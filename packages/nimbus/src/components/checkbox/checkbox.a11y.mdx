## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Checkbox>Test me</Checkbox>
```

### Accessibility standards

- Programmatically determine or provide information and relationships conveyed
  through presentation in text.

  with a clear, descriptive label.
- Ensure screen readers can access and interpret the checkbox label.
- Group related checkboxes using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to provide context.
- Label the checkbox group using `<legend>`.

#### 1.4.1 Use of color (Level A):
