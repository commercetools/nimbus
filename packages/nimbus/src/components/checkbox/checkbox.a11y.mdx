## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => <Checkbox>Test me</Checkbox>
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Info and relationships:** Programmatically determine or provide information
  and relationships conveyed through presentation in text. Use the `<label>`
  element and the `for` attribute to associate every checkbox with a clear,
  descriptive label. Ensure screen readers can access and interpret the checkbox
  label.
- **Group related checkboxes:** Group related checkboxes using `<fieldset>` and
  `<legend>` to provide context. Label the checkbox group using `<legend>`.
- **Use of color:** Avoid relying solely on color to convey information or
  checkbox state. Ensure the checked/unchecked state is programmatically
  determinable and conveyed through visual appearance (e.g., the checkbox's
  state).
- **Keyboard accessibility:** Make all checkbox functionality operable through a
  keyboard interface. Enable users to navigate to the checkbox using the Tab
  key. Allow users to change the checkbox state using the Spacebar or Enter key.
- **Clear purpose:** Make the purpose of the checkbox clear from the surrounding
  context or its label. Avoid generic labels like "Option" or "Select." Provide
  specific and descriptive labels.
- **Focus visible:** Provide a visible keyboard focus indicator for checkboxes.
  Visually indicate when a checkbox has focus (e.g., highlight, outline, change
  in appearance). Avoid relying solely on color change for focus indication.
- **Labels or instructions:** Provide clear labels or instructions for
  checkboxes. Reinforce the information provided by the `<label>` element. Aid
  users with cognitive disabilities by providing clear instructions.
