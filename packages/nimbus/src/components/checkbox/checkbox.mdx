# Checkbox

Checkbox allows for toggling of features, allowing users to select more than one
option where needed. Checkboxes support selected, unselected, indeterminate, and
disabled states.

## Overview

Checkboxes are commonly used in forms, settings panels, and other interactive
contexts where users can choose one or more options from a set. See below
variables for further choices.

### Resources

Deep dive into implementation details and access the Nimbus design library.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Selection

#### Unchecked

Represents the default or unchosen state.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Checkbox>Label</Checkbox>
```

#### Select

Visually confirms a user’s choice and is essential for form submissions and
interactive elements.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Checkbox isSelected>Label</Checkbox>
```

#### Indeterminate

If some, but not all, of the sub-options are selected, it will visually indicate
that the selection is partial or mixed.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Checkbox isIndeterminate>Label</Checkbox>
```

### Validation

#### Default

This is the standard initial state of the checkbox that doesn’t have a reason to
be invalid or disabled for the user.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Checkbox isSelected ml="600">Default tone</Checkbox>
```

#### Invalid

An invalid validation state for a checkbox indicates that the user's input (or
lack thereof) for that checkbox is not acceptable according to the application's
rules.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Checkbox isInvalid>Invalid</Checkbox>
```

#### Disabled

This is the styling of disabled elements. The icon is dimmed but the label
remains legible.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Checkbox isDisabled>Disabled</Checkbox>
```

### Vertical and horizontal lists

#### Vertical

Vertical lists are the most common and generally recommended approach for
checkbox lists unless there's a specific reason to use a different layout.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="400">
    <Checkbox>Option 1</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox>Option 2</Checkbox>
  </Stack>
)
```

#### Horizontal

These lists are best when they are concise, visually distinct, and don't require
much scanning. Used often in filters.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" gap="600">
    <Checkbox>Option 1</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox>Option 2</Checkbox>
  </Stack>
)
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Checkbox>Test me</Checkbox>
```

### Accessibility standards

#### 1.3.1 Info and relationships (Level A):

- Programmatically determine or provide information and relationships conveyed
  through presentation in text.
- Use the `<label>` element and the for attribute to associate every checkbox
  with a clear, descriptive label.
- Ensure screen readers can access and interpret the checkbox label.
- Group related checkboxes using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to provide context.
- Label the checkbox group using `<legend>`.

#### 1.4.1 Use of color (Level A):

- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information or checkbox state.
- Ensure the checked/unchecked state is programmatically determinable and
  conveyed through visual appearance (e.g., the checkbox's state).

#### 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A):

- Make all checkbox functionality operable through a keyboard interface.
- Enable users to navigate to the checkbox using the Tab key.
- Allow users to change the checkbox state using the Spacebar or Enter key.

#### 2.4.4 Link purpose (In Context) (Level A):

- Make the purpose of the checkbox clear from the surrounding context or its
  label.
- Avoid generic labels like "Option" or "Select."
- Provide specific and descriptive labels.

#### 2.4.7 Focus visible (Level AA):

- Provide a visible keyboard focus indicator for checkboxes.
- Visually indicate when a checkbox has focus (e.g., highlight, outline, change
  in appearance).
- Avoid relying solely on color change for focus indication.

#### 3.3.2 Labels or instructions (Level A):

- Provide clear labels or instructions for checkboxes.
- Reinforce the information provided by the `<label>` element.
- Aid users with cognitive disabilities by providing clear instructions.
