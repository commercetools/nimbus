## Overview

Checkboxes are commonly used in forms, settings panels, and other interactive
contexts where users can choose one or more options from a set. See below
variables for further choices.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Selection

#### Unchecked

Represents the default or unchosen state.

```jsx live
const App = () => <Checkbox>Label</Checkbox>
```

#### Select

Visually confirms a user’s choice and is essential for form submissions and
interactive elements.

```jsx live
const App = () => <Checkbox isSelected>Label</Checkbox>
```

#### Indeterminate

If some, but not all, of the sub-options are selected, it will visually indicate
that the selection is partial or mixed.

```jsx live
const App = () => <Checkbox isIndeterminate>Label</Checkbox>
```

### Validation

#### Default

This is the standard initial state of the checkbox that doesn’t have a reason to
be invalid or disabled for the user.

```jsx live
const App = () => <Checkbox isSelected ml="600">Default tone</Checkbox>
```

#### Invalid

An invalid validation state for a checkbox indicates that the user's input (or
lack thereof) for that checkbox is not acceptable according to the application's
rules.

```jsx live
const App = () => <Checkbox isInvalid>Invalid</Checkbox>
```

#### Disabled

This is the styling of disabled elements. The icon is dimmed but the label
remains legible.

```jsx live
const App = () => <Checkbox isDisabled>Disabled</Checkbox>
```

### Vertical and horizontal lists

#### Vertical

Vertical lists are the most common and generally recommended approach for
checkbox lists unless there's a specific reason to use a different layout.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="400">
    <Checkbox>Option 1</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox>Option 2</Checkbox>
  </Stack>
)
```

#### Horizontal

These lists are best when they are concise, visually distinct, and don't require
much scanning. Used often in filters.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" gap="600">
    <Checkbox>Option 1</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox>Option 2</Checkbox>
  </Stack>
)
```
