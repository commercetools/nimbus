# Password Input

A password input is a text field that hides entered characters for secure
password entry.

## Overview

Password input guidelines focus on creating secure and user-friendly fields for
entering sensitive credentials, emphasizing visual obscuring of input, clear
labeling and validation, accessibility considerations, and best practices for
password visibility toggles and error handling.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visual options

#### Medium

```jsx-live
const App = () => <PasswordInput placeholder="Enter a password" />
```

#### Small

```jsx-live
const App = () => <PasswordInput placeholder="Enter a password" size="sm" />
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <PasswordInput
    placeholder="Enter a password"
    autoComplete="current-password"
    aria-label="Password"
  />
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- Always provide a visible label for the input.
- Clearly associate the label with the input using the for attribute on the
  `<label>` and a matching id on the `<input type="password">`.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all elements (text, borders, icons, focus
  indicators).
- Clearly indicate the focused state.
- Support keyboard navigation:
  - Use Tab to navigate to and from the input.
  - Allow users to copy, cut, and paste using standard keyboard shortcuts
    (Ctrl/Cmd + C, Ctrl/Cmd + X, Ctrl/Cmd + V).
- Communicate errors clearly, using both visual cues (e.g., color) and
  descriptive error messages.
- Provide a toggle to show/hide password characters. Ensure this toggle is
  keyboard accessible and clearly labeled (e.g., "Show password" / "Hide
  password").
- Use autocomplete="current-password" or autocomplete="new-password" as
  appropriate to allow browsers and password managers to offer autofill.
- Avoid automatically masking pasted content.
- Do not disable the paste functionality.
