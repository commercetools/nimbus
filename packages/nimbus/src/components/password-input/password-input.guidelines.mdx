## Guidelines

Password field guidelines provide designers with best practices for creating
secure and usable password entry, covering visual obscuring, clear labeling and
validation, accessibility, and optional features like password visibility
toggles.

### Best practices

- **Clear labeling:** Always use a visible and descriptive label (e.g.,
  "Password") placed outside the input field. Avoid using placeholder text as
  the sole label.
- **Visual obscuring:** Ensure entered characters are masked by default for
  security.
- **Password visibility toggle:** Provide a clear and easily accessible button
  to allow users to temporarily view the password they've typed. This helps
  prevent errors.
- **Contextual help:** Display this requirement clearly upfront if there are
  particular details that users need to be mindful of such as length or
  inclusion of special characters.
- **Inline validation:** When applicable, offer real-time feedback as users
  type, indicating whether they meet the password requirements.
- **Clear error handling:** If the entered password is incorrect, provide a
  clear and helpful error message that doesn't reveal too much information about
  why it's wrong.
- **Password reset link:** Make the "Forgot Password" link easily discoverable
  near the password input field.
- **Allow pasting:** Generally, allow users to paste passwords from password
  managers.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the password field and its associated elements
  (label, toggle, error messages) are accessible to users with disabilities,
  including screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.

## Usage

A password field provides a secure text input for users to enter confidential
credentials, visually obscuring the typed characters to protect them from being
seen by others.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use
- **Authentication:** For securely entering credentials when logging into
  accounts or accessing protected information.
- **Account creation:** When users are setting up new accounts and need to
  define a secret password.
- **Sensitive data entry:** In situations where users need to input confidential
  information that should not be visible to others.
- **Confirmation of sensitive actions:** Occasionally used to re-authenticate
  users before performing critical actions.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use
- **Non-sensitive text entry:** For regular text input where privacy is not a
  concern (e.g., usernames, search queries, messages). Use a standard text input
  field instead.
- **Displaying existing passwords:** Never use a password input to show a user
  their currently saved password by default (unless using the "Show password"
  toggle).
- **Forced complexity rules without explanation:** Avoid requiring complex
  passwords in a password input without clearly explaining the rules before the
  user types.

## Password labeling and messaging

Best practices for password input labeling involve using clear, persistent
labels and providing concise, helpful error messages that guide users to meet
password requirements without revealing security vulnerabilities.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do use clear and visible labels outside the input field.
> - Do use inline validation to give immediate feedback.
> - Do make the "Forgot Password" link easily accessible.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't use placeholder text as the sole label.
> - Don't provide overly specific error messages that could reveal security
>   information (e.g., "Your password needs a special character").

## Password requirements and view

Password requirements clearly communicate the rules for creating a secure
password, while password viewing provides a temporary way for users to check
their input for accuracy.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do enforce a reasonable minimum password length.
> - Do provide clear, upfront feedback on password requirements.
> - If possible include real time validation for the requirements for password
>   creation.
> - Do mask the entered characters by default (e.g., with asterisks or dots).
> - Do provide a "Show Password" toggle for users to verify their input.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't enforce overly complex password rules without clear explanation.
> - Don't use password fields for non-sensitive information.
> - Don't auto-submit the form when the password field is filled.
> - Don't reveal the password by default.
> - Don't make the "Show Password" toggle difficult to find or use.
