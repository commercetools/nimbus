## Guidelines

SearchInput guidelines focus on creating clear, accessible, and user-friendly
search experiences by emphasizing proper placeholder text, clear visual
feedback, and keyboard accessibility.

### Best practices

- **Provide clear placeholder text:** Use brief, descriptive text inside the
  field (e.g., "Search products," "Find a customer") to indicate what can be
  searched.
- **Offer suggestions:** Implement type-ahead or autocomplete to offer relevant
  suggestions as the user types, improving speed and accuracy.
- **Include a clear button:** Provide a control, often an "X" icon, to quickly
  clear the search query. This is typically placed on the right side of the
  field.
- **Maintain consistency:** Place the search input in a predictable,
  easy-to-find location, such as the primary navigation bar or near the content
  being searched.
- **Support keyboard interaction:** Ensure the input field and its associated
  suggestions are fully navigable using the keyboard (e.g., Tab, Enter, Arrow
  keys).
- **Live Search:** The core function should be to trigger search or filtering
  logic on every value change (onChange), enabling an instantaneous search
  experience (live-search or auto-complete).
- **Loading states:** Consider showing loading indicators when search is in
  progress.
- **Immediate feedback:** Show search results as users type (debounced) or on
  submission.
- **Error handling:** Display clear error messages when searches fail.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Live search:** You need to narrow down a visible list, table, or grid of
  items instantly as the user types. The search results update in real-time on
  the same screen.
- **Autocomplete/Suggestions:** You need to provide a set of contextual
  suggestions that appear in a dropdown while the user is typing, leading to a
  final selection or submission.
- **Global/Site-wide search:** The input serves as the primary entry point for
  finding content across the entire application or website.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Simple filtering**: If filtering is better handled by dropdowns or
  checkboxes.
- **Form submission**: Don't use for general text inputs that aren't
  search-related.
- **Complex queries**: When users need advanced search features like boolean
  operators or multiple fields.

### Do's and Don'ts

> [!TIP]\

)
```

> [!CAUTION]\

```jsx-live

)
```
