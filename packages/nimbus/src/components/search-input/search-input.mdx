# SearchInput

Allows users to discover and filter content by entering text to help users find relevant information efficiently.

## Overview

Search inputs provide a dedicated text field for users to enter keywords or phrases to query and retrieve matching data or content. They are essential for navigating large amounts of information.

### Resources

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visual Options

#### Size

The medium size of the SearchInput is default, the small size is meant for more compact uses.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="400" alignItems="center">
    <SearchInput size="md" placeholder="Search..." />
    <SearchInput size="sm" placeholder="Search..." />
  </Stack>
)
```

### Appearance

Allows switching the visual style between solid and ghost appearance.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="400" alignItems="center">
    <SearchInput variant="solid" placeholder="Search..." />
    <SearchInput variant="ghost" placeholder="Search..." />
  </Stack>
)
```

## Guidelines

SearchInput guidelines focus on creating clear, accessible, and user-friendly search experiences by emphasizing proper placeholder text, clear visual feedback, and keyboard accessibility.

### Best practices

- **Provide clear placeholder text:** Use brief, descriptive text inside the field (e.g., "Search products," "Find a customer") to indicate what can be searched.
- **Offer suggestions:** Implement type-ahead or autocomplete to offer relevant suggestions as the user types, improving speed and accuracy.
- **Include a clear button:** Provide a control, often an "X" icon, to quickly clear the search query. This is typically placed on the right side of the field.
- **Maintain consistency:** Place the search input in a predictable, easy-to-find location, such as the primary navigation bar or near the content being searched.
- **Support keyboard interaction:** Ensure the input field and its associated suggestions are fully navigable using the keyboard (e.g., Tab, Enter, Arrow keys).
- **Live Search:** The core function should be to trigger search or filtering logic on every value change (onChange), enabling an instantaneous search experience (live-search or auto-complete).
- **Loading states:** Consider showing loading indicators when search is in progress.
- **Immediate feedback:** Show search results as users type (debounced) or on submission.
- **Error handling:** Display clear error messages when searches fail.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Live search:** You need to narrow down a visible list, table, or grid of items instantly as the user types. The search results update in real-time on the same screen.
- **Autocomplete/Suggestions:** You need to provide a set of contextual suggestions that appear in a dropdown while the user is typing, leading to a final selection or submission.
- **Global/Site-wide search:** The input serves as the primary entry point for finding content across the entire application or website.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Simple filtering**: If filtering is better handled by dropdowns or checkboxes.
- **Form submission**: Don't use for general text inputs that aren't search-related.
- **Complex queries**: When users need advanced search features like boolean operators or multiple fields.

### Do's and Don'ts

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>- Provide clear placeholder text

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <SearchInput placeholder="Search by name..." />
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>- Avoid long descriptive placeholders

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <SearchInput width="440px" placeholder="Please enter the name you are searching for" />
)
```
