## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <SearchInput
    placeholder="Search products..."
    aria-label="Search"
  />
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- Always provide a visible label or clear `aria-label` for the search input.
- Use `type="search"` or `role="search"` to identify the search functionality to
  assistive technologies.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all elements (text, borders, icons, focus
  indicators).
- Clearly indicate the focused state with visible focus indicators.
- Support keyboard navigation using Tab to focus and Enter to submit search.
- Provide clear feedback when search results are loading or no results are
  found.
- Announce search results and status changes to screen readers using ARIA live
  regions.
- Include a clear button to reset or clear the search input.
- If search suggestions appear, ensure they are keyboard accessible and properly
  announced.
