## Guidelines

Calendar guidelines focus on creating intuitive and accessible interfaces for
viewing, navigating, and interacting with dates and events.

### Best practices

- **Clear visual hierarchy:** Distinguish between days, weeks, months, and
  years. Highlight the current date and any selected dates.
- **Intuitive navigation:** Provide clear controls to move between different
  time periods (days, weeks, months, years).
- **Easy date range selection:** For applications requiring date ranges, provide
  an intuitive way to select start and end dates, often with visual
  highlighting.
- **Clear labels and instructions:** Provide clear labels for navigation
  controls and any interactive elements within the calendar.

### Usage

A calendar is used to visually display and manage time-based information,
allowing users to view, schedule, and interact with dates. A common way this
component is used is within the popover, and paired with the date input.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Scheduling:** When users need to select specific dates.
- **Visualizing time-based data:** To display data or to filter data in a
  corresponding visual.
- **Date range selection:** When users need to select a start and end date for a
  period.
- **Browsing dates:** When users need to navigate through different days, weeks,
  or months to find a specific date.
- **Contextual awareness of dates:** When the day of the week or the
  relationship between dates is important for decision-making.
- **Recurring events:** To allow users to set up and manage events that repeat
  on a regular basis.

### Keeping interactions simple

Simple calendar interactions are vital because they minimize user effort and
cognitive load, allowing for quick and efficient time management, the calendar's
primary function.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Provide clear navigation. Make it easy to move between days, weeks, months,
>   and years using intuitive controls (arrows, drop downs).
> - Enable easy date range selection. If your application requires date ranges,
>   make the selection process straightforward (e.g., click start, click end).
> - Consider time zones (if applicable). If your application deals with users in
>   different time zones, handle and display times accordingly.
> - Ensure navigation controls are clearly labeled and their function is
>   obvious.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <RangeCalendar
    defaultValue={{
      start: new CalendarDate(2025, 5, 2),
      end: new CalendarDate(2025, 5, 11),
    }}
  />
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't over clutter. Avoid displaying too much information on the calendar
>   grid at once, which can make it overwhelming.
> - Don't make navigation confusing. Ensure navigation controls are clearly
>   labeled and their function is obvious.
> - Don't use it for simple date input. If users know the exact date, a direct
>   date input field might be more efficient.
> - Don't auto-submit on date selection. Avoid automatically submitting forms or
>   triggering actions immediately after a date is selected.
