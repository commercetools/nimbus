## Guidelines

Number input guidelines focus on clear labels, suitable ranges, easy interaction
via keyboard and buttons, and strong error handling, all while following WCAG
accessibility rules.

### Best practices

- **Labels:** Always include a concise and clear label using sentence case.
  Labels should not be hidden. In the rare case where context is sufficient and
  label can be absent, review the design with an accessibility expert.
- **Default values:** Provide a clear and logical default time when possible
  (e.g., current time, a common start time like 9:00 AM). Avoid leaving the
  input blank.
- **Helper text:** Use helper text to indicate the expected time format (e.g.,
  "HH:MM AM/PM", "24-hour format") or other constraints like valid time ranges.
  It is optional and is replaced by error messages during validation.
- **Validation:**
  - Provide clear and concise error messages below the input field, replacing
    any helper text.
  - Highlight errors visually, for example, with a red border and an error icon.
  - Validate the entered time against any defined constraints (e.g., valid time
    format, time within allowed range).

## Usage

A time input enables users to enter or select a specific time, offering
flexibility while maintaining precision.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- Inputting a specific time of day (e.g., appointment times, event schedules).
- When time is a discrete data point rather than a duration.
- When users need to select from a predefined set of time slots.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- For durations (e.g., "5 hours 30 minutes"); use a separate duration input or a
  set of number inputs.
- When a broad range of continuous times is needed and exact entry is less
  critical; a simple text input with a time format mask might suffice.
- When users need to select a time zone along with the time; use a dedicated
  time and time zone selector.

## Keeping interactions simple

Time inputs should be straightforward and require minimal effort from the user.
This includes clear labeling and error states, and aiding the user with
defaults.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Always include a label.
> - Set a clear default time when relevant.
> - Provide helper text for format or range constraints.
> - Offer clear error messages and visual indicators.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <FormField.Root isInvalid>
    <FormField.Label>Start time</FormField.Label>
    <FormField.Input>
      <TimeInput
        size="md"
        hourCycle={24}
        defaultValue={new Time(20, 15)}
        width="50%"
      />
    </FormField.Input>
     <FormField.Error>
      Start time can only be :30, :45, or :00.
    </FormField.Error>
  </FormField.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - You cannot use a time input for durations, instead use a date range input.
> - Do not rely solely on color to indicate errors.
> - Never hide labels.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <TimeInput
    size="md"
    hourCycle={24}
    defaultValue={new Time(20, 15)}
    width="50%"
  />
);
```
