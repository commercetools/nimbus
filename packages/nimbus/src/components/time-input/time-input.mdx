# Time input

A time input allows users to enter and select a specific time. It supports
flexible input methods while ensuring accuracy and ease of use.

## Overview

A time input enables users to enter and select a specific time. It offers
flexible input methods while maintaining accuracy and usability.

### Resources

Deep dive into implementation details and access the Nimbus design library.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visual options

#### Size

Medium size is the default sizing used most commonly, with a small size for
compact use cases.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Grid templateColumns="repeat(2, 1fr)" gap="400">
    <TimeInput
      size="md"
      hourCycle={24}
      defaultValue={new Time(20, 0)}
    />
    <TimeInput
      size="sm"
      hourCycle={12}
      defaultValue={new Time(9, 30)}
    />
  </Grid>
);
```

#### Solid appearance

This is the default styling, it provides a more prominent, filled style for
standard form usage where the input needs to stand out clearly.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <TimeInput
    size="md"
    hourCycle={12}
    defaultValue={new Time(15, 45)}
    width="50%"
  />
);
```

#### Ghost appearance

Offers a minimalist style (e.g., no background fill, just a border) for
integration into uncluttered interfaces or specific contexts.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <TimeInput
    size="md"
    variant="ghost"
    hourCycle={24}
    defaultValue={new Time(7, 0)}
    width="50%"
  />
);
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <TimeInput
    size="md"
    hourCycle={24}
    defaultValue={new Time(10, 10)}
    width="50%"
  />
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Provide clear labeling:** Use a `<label>` element that is programmatically
  associated with the input field.
- **Indicate required fields:** Visually mark required fields (e.g., with an
  asterisk) and programmatically denote them using `aria-required="true"`.
- **Set an appropriate input type:** Use `type="time"` for native browser
  accessibility features and keyboard support.
- **Include helpful instructions:** Offer clear instructions or formatting
  guidance for the expected time format.
- **Enable keyboard navigation:** Ensure users can tab through the input and
  select times using only a keyboard.
- **Support screen reader announcements:** Verify that screen readers announce
  the input's purpose, current value, and any validation errors.
- **Manage focus:** Maintain logical focus order when users interact with the
  time input, especially with custom pickers.
- **Provide accessible error messages:** Display validation errors clearly and
  associate them with the input using `aria-describedby`.
- **Use sufficient color contrast:** Ensure all text and interactive elements
  have adequate color contrast against their background.
- **Design for different input methods:** Consider touch targets for mobile
  users and ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.
- **Test with assistive technologies:** Validate accessibility with screen
  readers and keyboard-only navigation.
