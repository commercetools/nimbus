# TimeInput

A time input allows users to enter and select a specific time. It supports
flexible input methods while ensuring accuracy and ease of use.

## Overview

A time input enables users to enter and select a specific time. It offers
flexible input methods while maintaining accuracy and usability.

### Resources

Deep dive into implementation details and access the Nimbus design library.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visual options

#### Size

Medium size is the default sizing used most commonly, with a small size for
compact use cases.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Grid templateColumns="repeat(2, 1fr)" gap="400">
    <TimeInput
      size="md"
      hourCycle={24}
      defaultValue={new Time(20, 0)}
    />
    <TimeInput
      size="sm"
      hourCycle={12}
      defaultValue={new Time(9, 30)}
    />
  </Grid>
);
```

#### Solid appearance

This is the default styling, it provides a more prominent, filled style for
standard form usage where the input needs to stand out clearly.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <TimeInput
    size="md"
    hourCycle={12}
    defaultValue={new Time(15, 45)}
    width="50%"
  />
);
```

#### Ghost appearance

Offers a minimalist style (e.g., no background fill, just a border) for
integration into uncluttered interfaces or specific contexts.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <TimeInput
    size="md"
    variant="ghost"
    hourCycle={24}
    defaultValue={new Time(7, 0)}
    width="50%"
  />
);
```

## Guidelines

Number input guidelines focus on clear labels, suitable ranges, easy interaction
via keyboard and buttons, and strong error handling, all while following WCAG
accessibility rules.

### Best practices

- **Labels:** Always include a concise and clear label using sentence case.
  Labels should not be hidden. In the rare case where context is sufficient and
  label can be absent, review the design with an accessibility expert.
- **Default values:** Provide a clear and logical default time when possible
  (e.g., current time, a common start time like 9:00 AM). Avoid leaving the
  input blank.
- **Helper text:** Use helper text to indicate the expected time format (e.g.,
  "HH:MM AM/PM", "24-hour format") or other constraints like valid time ranges.
  It is optional and is replaced by error messages during validation.
- **Validation:**
  - Provide clear and concise error messages below the input field, replacing
    any helper text.
  - Highlight errors visually, for example, with a red border and an error icon.
  - Validate the entered time against any defined constraints (e.g., valid time
    format, time within allowed range).

## Usage

A time input enables users to enter or select a specific time, offering
flexibility while maintaining precision.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- Inputting a specific time of day (e.g., appointment times, event schedules).
- When time is a discrete data point rather than a duration.
- When users need to select from a predefined set of time slots.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- For durations (e.g., "5 hours 30 minutes"); use a separate duration input or a
  set of number inputs.
- When a broad range of continuous times is needed and exact entry is less
  critical; a simple text input with a time format mask might suffice.
- When users need to select a time zone along with the time; use a dedicated
  time and time zone selector.

## Keeping interactions simple

Time inputs should be straightforward and require minimal effort from the user.
This includes clear labeling and error states, and aiding the user with
defaults.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Always include a label.
> - Set a clear default time when relevant.
> - Provide helper text for format or range constraints.
> - Offer clear error messages and visual indicators.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <FormField.Root isInvalid>
    <FormField.Label>Start time</FormField.Label>
    <FormField.Input>
      <TimeInput
        size="md"
        hourCycle={24}
        defaultValue={new Time(20, 15)}
        width="50%"
      />
    </FormField.Input>
     <FormField.Error>
      Start time can only be :30, :45, or :00.
    </FormField.Error>
  </FormField.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - You cannot use a time input for durations, instead use a date range input.
> - Do not rely solely on color to indicate errors.
> - Never hide labels.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <TimeInput
    size="md"
    hourCycle={24}
    defaultValue={new Time(20, 15)}
    width="50%"
  />
);
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <TimeInput
    size="md"
    hourCycle={24}
    defaultValue={new Time(10, 10)}
    width="50%"
  />
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Provide clear labeling:** Use a `<label>` element that is programmatically
  associated with the input field.
- **Indicate required fields:** Visually mark required fields (e.g., with an
  asterisk) and programmatically denote them using `aria-required="true"`.
- **Set an appropriate input type:** Use `type="time"` for native browser
  accessibility features and keyboard support.
- **Include helpful instructions:** Offer clear instructions or formatting
  guidance for the expected time format.
- **Enable keyboard navigation:** Ensure users can tab through the input and
  select times using only a keyboard.
- **Support screen reader announcements:** Verify that screen readers announce
  the input's purpose, current value, and any validation errors.
- **Manage focus:** Maintain logical focus order when users interact with the
  time input, especially with custom pickers.
- **Provide accessible error messages:** Display validation errors clearly and
  associate them with the input using `aria-describedby`.
- **Use sufficient color contrast:** Ensure all text and interactive elements
  have adequate color contrast against their background.
- **Design for different input methods:** Consider touch targets for mobile
  users and ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.
- **Test with assistive technologies:** Validate accessibility with screen
  readers and keyboard-only navigation.
