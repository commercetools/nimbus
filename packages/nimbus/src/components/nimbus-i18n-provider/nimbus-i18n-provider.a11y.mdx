## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <NimbusI18nProvider locale="en-US">
    <Text>Content with proper locale formatting</Text>
  </NimbusI18nProvider>
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Provide valid locale codes:** Always provide a valid BCP47 language tag
  (e.g., `en-US`, `de-DE`, `fr-FR`) to ensure proper formatting and
  pronunciation.
- **Use region-specific codes:** Use region-specific codes when formatting
  differs (e.g., date order, decimal separators, number formatting).
- **Locale-appropriate formatting:** Dates, numbers, and currency are announced
  in locale-appropriate formats by screen readers.
- **Proper pronunciation:** Screen readers use the specified locale for correct
  pronunciation of content.
- **ARIA labels reflect locale conventions:** Ensures ARIA labels and
  announcements follow locale conventions.
- **Test with screen readers:** Always test with actual screen readers to verify
  proper pronunciation and formatting.
