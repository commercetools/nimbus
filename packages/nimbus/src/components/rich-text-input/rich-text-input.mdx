# RichTextInput

The rich text input component allows users to input and format text using a user
friendly interface. Changing standard text inputs into fully featured edits,
supporting formatting, linking, and embedding.

## Overview

Rich text input is made of two parts, the input where users can add text, and a
toolbar. This toolbar has been arranged to suit user's needs for text editing.

### Resources

Deep dive on details and access design library.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Live demo

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <RichTextInput
      value={value}
      onChange={setValue}
      placeholder="Start typing and try the formatting tools..."
    />
  );
};
```

### Toolbar features

Users can change type styles, toggle bold, italics, underline, strikethrough,
code sections, superscript, subscript, bullet points and numbered lists. Undo
and redo buttons are icon buttons.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("<p><strong>Nimbus</strong> dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam <em>component</em> felis, vel consistency elementum. Sed design tokens ut turpis ac <u>user experience</u> maximus. Integer accessibility vitae nibh id clarity interface tincidunt.</p>");

  return (
    <RichTextInput
      value={value}
      onChange={setValue}
      placeholder="Try formatting some text..."
    />
  );
};
```

### Minimum and maximum height

These can be fully configured as needed. Toolbar should remain sticky to the top
of the input. Set the minimum height to ensure at least a few lines of content
are visible.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("<p>Nimbus dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam component felis, vel consistency elementum. Sed design tokens ut turpis ac user experience maximus. Integer accessibility vitae nibh id clarity interface tincidunt.</p>");

  return (
    <RichTextInput
      minHeight="300px"
      maxHeight="500px"
      value={value}
      onChange={setValue}
      placeholder="Start typing..."
    />
  );
};
```

## Guidelines

These guidelines provide comprehensive direction for designing and developing
rich text inputs within Nimbus.

### Best practices

- **Make responsive changes:** Apply changes immediately to the selected text
  upon clicking a toolbar control.
- **Utilize tooltips and labels:** Include tooltips for all toolbar actions to
  enhance discoverability and accessibility.
- **Keep a user's focus:** Maintain the user's focus within the text area after
  an action or toggle is selected.
- **Allow for common shortcuts:** Support standard keyboard shortcuts for
  formatting (e.g., Ctrl/Cmd+B for bold).
- **Make it easier to correct mistakes:** Offer an undo/redo history for content
  changes, and allow for a large enough input window so a user can quickly read
  content without needing to scroll line by line.
- **Tailor tooling:** Determine the required formatting options based on the
  user's needs for the specific application.
- **Curate tools into meaningful similar collections:** Group related controls
  logically in the toolbar (e.g., text styling, lists, media).

## Usage

Rich text inputs should be used in areas where a user knows that a longer
response or description is expected.

### When to use

> [!TIP]\
> When to use
>
> - **Editing long-form content:** Such as product descriptions, knowledge base
>   articles, or email bodies, where visual hierarchy and style are necessary
>   for readability.
> - **Formatting text:** Such as applying bold, italics, underlines, or specific
>   heading levels.
> - **Structuring content:** With bulleted or numbered lists.
> - **Embedding external elements:** Like links, images, or videos within other
>   content.

### When not to use

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use
>
> - **Short answers:** Or single-line inputs, such as names, titles, or search
>   queries.
> - **Specific data entry:** Unformatted text is required, like SKUs, passwords,
>   or simple codes.
> - **Plain text communication:** Such as chat messages or comments, where
>   formatting options can clutter the interface or distract from the
>   conversation.
> - **Inputs that need to be strictly controlled:** Where the application's
>   style guide should be the only source of formatting (e.g., when there is
>   passing through of styling and content to another site).

### Tags and tag group in use

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do use tooltips for tools represented by icons. In the case of paragraph
>   styles show the style in the dropdown, not just stated in plain text.
> - Do provide more height for the input to see a few lines of text and reduce
>   scrolling.
> - Do utilize an undo and redo button to assist a user with writing and editing
>   text when possible.

![Do](/images/rich-text-input/rich-text-input-do.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't make the input so small that you cannot easily see a few lines of
>   text.
> - Don't move the rich text toolbar to sit on the bottom of the input.
> - Don't overload the rich text toolbar with tools that are unnecessary.

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

### Accessibility standards

The RichTextInput component follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines and implements proper
accessibility features:

#### Semantic Markup

Ensure the editor outputs semantic HTML (e.g., `<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<strong>`) to be
correctly interpreted by screen readers.

#### Keyboard Access

- All toolbar controls are accessible via the Tab key
- Users can navigate and apply formatting without a mouse
- Standard keyboard shortcuts are supported (Cmd/Ctrl+B for bold, Cmd/Ctrl+I for
  italic, Cmd/Ctrl+U for underline)

#### ARIA

Apply appropriate ARIA attributes to the toolbar and its controls, such as:

- `aria-label` for toggle icon buttons
- `role="toolbar"` for the formatting toolbar
- `role="textbox"` for the editable area
- `aria-disabled` for disabled states

#### Focus Management

- Clear focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Focus remains within the text area after formatting actions
- Logical tab order through toolbar controls

#### Screen Reader Support

- Proper labels for all toolbar buttons and controls
- Text style dropdown shows style names clearly
- State changes are announced appropriately
