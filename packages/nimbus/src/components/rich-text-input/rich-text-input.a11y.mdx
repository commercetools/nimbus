## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <RichTextInput
      value={value}
      onChange={setValue}
      placeholder="Start typing..."
    />
  );
};
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Semantic markup:** Ensure the editor outputs semantic HTML (e.g., `<h1>`,
  `<ul>`, `<strong>`) to be correctly interpreted by screen readers.
- **Keyboard access:** Ensure all toolbar controls are accessible via the tab
  key. Users must be able to navigate and apply formatting without a mouse.
- **ARIA:** Apply appropriate ARIA attributes to the toolbar and its controls,
  such as `aria-label` for toggle icon buttons.
