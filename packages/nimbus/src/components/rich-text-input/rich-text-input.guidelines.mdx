## Guidelines

These guidelines provide comprehensive direction for designing and developing
rich text inputs within Nimbus.

### Best practices

- **Make responsive changes:** Apply changes immediately to the selected text
  upon clicking a toolbar control.
- **Utilize tooltips and labels:** Include tooltips for all toolbar actions to
  enhance discoverability and accessibility.
- **Keep a user's focus:** Maintain the user's focus within the text area after
  an action or toggle is selected.
- **Allow for common shortcuts:** Support standard keyboard shortcuts for
  formatting (e.g., Ctrl/Cmd+B for bold).
- **Make it easier to correct mistakes:** Offer an undo/redo history for content
  changes, and allow for a large enough input window so a user can quickly read
  content without needing to scroll line by line.
- **Tailor tooling:** Determine the required formatting options based on the
  user's needs for the specific application.
- **Curate tools into meaningful similar collections:** Group related controls
  logically in the toolbar (e.g., text styling, lists, media).

## Usage

Rich text inputs should be used in areas where a user knows that a longer
response or description is expected.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Editing long-form content:** Such as product descriptions, knowledge base
  articles, or email bodies, where visual hierarchy and style are necessary for
  readability.
- **Formatting text:** Such as applying bold, italics, underlines, or specific
  heading levels.
- **Structuring content:** With bulleted or numbered lists.
- **Embedding external elements:** Like links, images, or videos within other
  content.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Short answers:** Or single-line inputs, such as names, titles, or search
  queries.
- **Specific data entry:** Unformatted text is required, like SKUs, passwords,
  or simple codes.
- **Plain text communication:** Such as chat messages or comments, where
  formatting options can clutter the interface or distract from the
  conversation.
- **Inputs that need to be strictly controlled:** Where the application's style
  guide should be the only source of formatting (e.g., when there is passing
  through of styling and content to another site).

### Rich text input in use

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do use tooltips for tools represented by icons. In the case of paragraph
>   styles show the style in the dropdown, not just stated in plain text.
> - Do provide more height for the input to see a few lines of text and reduce
>   scrolling.
> - Do utilize an undo and redo button to assist a user with writing and editing
>   text when possible.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <RichTextInput
    defaultValue="<p>Nimbus dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam component felis, vel consistency elementum. Sed design tokens ut turpis ac <strong>user experience</strong> maximus. Integer accessibility vitae nibh id clarity interface tincidunt.</p>"
    placeholder="Write your product description here."
  />
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't make the input so small that you cannot easily see a few lines of
>   text.
> - Don't move the rich text toolbar to sit on the bottom of the input.
> - Don't overload the rich text toolbar with tools that are unnecessary.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <RichTextInput
    height="2000"
    defaultValue="<p>Nimbus dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam component felis, vel consistency elementum. Sed design tokens ut turpis ac <strong>user experience</strong> maximus. Integer accessibility vitae nibh id clarity interface tincidunt.</p>"
    placeholder="Write your product description here."
  />
);
```
