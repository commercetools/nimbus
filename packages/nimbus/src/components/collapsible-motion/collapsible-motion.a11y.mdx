## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onPress={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>
        {isOpen ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'} Content
      </Button>
      <CollapsibleMotion isOpen={isOpen}>
        <Box p="400">
          <Text>Collapsible content with smooth animation</Text>
        </Box>
      </CollapsibleMotion>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Clear trigger elements:** Always provide clear, descriptive trigger buttons
  or elements that indicate their purpose.
- **Semantic HTML structure:** Use semantic HTML within collapsible content to
  ensure proper document structure.
- **Clear focus indicators:** Ensure trigger elements have clear, visible focus
  indicators for keyboard navigation.
- **State communication:** Use appropriate ARIA attributes to communicate the
  expanded/collapsed state to screen readers.
- **Animation considerations:** Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` user
  preferences for users with vestibular disorders.
