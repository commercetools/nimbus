## Guidelines

Radio input guidelines focus on providing a clear, accessible, and mutually
exclusive set of options, ensuring users can easily understand the available
choices and select only one, with clear visual indication of the selected state
and proper labeling for accessibility.

### Best practices

- **Clear and concise labels:** Ensure each radio input has a descriptive label
  placed consistently (usually to the right).
- **Logical grouping:** Enclose related radio inputs within a `<fieldset>`
  element and provide a clear `<legend>` to describe the group's purpose.
- **Visual distinction:** Clearly indicate the selected state (e.g., filled
  circle) and the non-selected state (e.g., empty circle).
- **Sufficient spacing:** Provide enough spacing between radio inputs and their
  labels for easy selection.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** Ensure users can navigate through radio inputs
  using the Tab key and select an option using the arrow keys and Spacebar.
- **Clear default selection (use sparingly):** Only pre-select a radio input if
  there's a genuinely logical default option. Avoid forcing a choice
  unnecessarily.
- **Avoid too many options:** If you have a long list of mutually exclusive
  choices, consider a dropdown select instead.

### Usage

Radio inputs are used when you need users to pick a single choice from a limited
number of options, presenting all possibilities upfront for easy comparison and
selection of just one.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Single selection required:** When users must choose only one option from a
  predefined list.
- **Limited number of options:** When the number of choices is relatively small
  (typically 2-5) and all options can be displayed clearly.
- **Equal importance of options:** When all choices are presented as equally
  valid and the user needs to make a deliberate selection.
- **Visual comparison is beneficial:** When seeing all available options at once
  helps users understand and compare them before choosing.
- **Clear and mutually exclusive choices:** When the options are distinct and
  there's no possibility of selecting more than one.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Multiple selections allowed:** If users can select more than one option, use
  checkboxes instead.
- **Large number of options:** For long lists of choices, a dropdown select is
  more space-efficient.
- **Obscure or infrequently used options:** If many options are rarely chosen, a
  dropdown can hide them until needed, reducing visual clutter.
- **Saving screen space is critical:** Radio inputs display all options, which
  can take up significant space, especially on smaller screens.
- **Default selection is strongly preferred:** If one option is almost always
  the correct choice, a pre-selected checkbox might be more efficient (with
  clear indication that it can be unchecked).
- **Complex or dynamic options:** When the available choices change frequently
  or depend on other user inputs, a dynamic select or autocomplete field might
  be better.

### Limited options

Radio inputs work best when there are a limited number of options for a user.

> **Do**

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not use radio inputs when there are an excessive amount of options. Radio
>   input options on default will show every option to a user so it can be
>   overwhelming for a user when there is a lot of information to digest in a
>   small area. Instead, use a dropdown selector to simplify the UI and make it
>   easier to search quickly to find the right option.
