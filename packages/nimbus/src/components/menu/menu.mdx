# Menu

A temporary surface that displays a list of choices or actions. It typically
appears when a user interacts with an element like a button or icon, or performs
a specific action.

## Overview

Menus present short, actionable items in a vertical list, ensuring easy
navigation and selection. They display below the trigger with a 8px space. To
close a menu, a user makes a selection, or in the case several selections may be
made, after a confirm button or a click off the active area.
