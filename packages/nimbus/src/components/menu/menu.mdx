# Menu

A temporary surface that displays a list of choices or actions. It typically
appears when a user interacts with an element like a button or icon, or performs
a specific action.

## Overview

Menus present short, actionable items in a vertical list, ensuring easy
navigation and selection. They display below the trigger with a 8px space. To
close a menu, a user makes a selection, or in the case several selections may be
made, after a confirm button or a click off the active area.

## Guidelines

Menu guidelines focus on providing temporary, contextual information or actions
in a clear and accessible manner, ensuring they are easily triggered, navigable
via keyboard, and don't disrupt the user's primary workflow.

### Best practices

- **Clear trigger:** Make the trigger element visually distinct and interactive.
  Use consistent icons or labels for dropdown triggers.
- **Logical content:** Order options logically (alphabetical, frequency, etc.).
  Keep content concise and actionable.
- **Easy interaction:** If interaction involves a single selection, close the
  popover upon selection. Keep the popover open if more complicated content
  needs several selections.
- **Responsive behavior:** Adapt the dropdown's position and size to different
  screen sizes. Ensure it works well on touch devices.
- **Visual feedback:** Highlight the selected option. Use clear hover states.
- **Keyboard navigation:** Allow users to navigate options with arrow keys.
  Enable selection with Enter/Spacebar. Enable closing the popover with the
  Escape key.
- **ARIA attributes:** Use `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-label`
  for screen reader support. Manage focus correctly when the popover opens and
  closes.
- **Avoid nested dropdowns:** Keep the structure simple and avoid nested menus.
- **Contextual placement:** Position the dropdown near the trigger element
  without obscuring important content.
- **Limit content:** Keep the content to simple actions, or short text.
- **Use sections correctly:** Use sections only if you have more than 2 groups
  to organize. It is unneeded to have sections if the information is collected
  together.

#### Common popover content

These are some of the most seen uses of popover content. These are included in
the figma library components to make designing common shared uses easier.

**Simple List**

Allows the user select one option, add a search to allow users to make selection
easier if there are many options. For options 5 or fewer, a search is not
needed.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
      <Menu.Trigger asChild>
        <IconButton
          variant="ghost"
          colorPalette="neutral"
          aria-label="More options"
        >
          <Icons.MoreVert />
        </IconButton>
      </Menu.Trigger>
    <Menu.Content>
      <Menu.Item id="menu-item-1">Menu Item</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="menu-item-2">Menu Item</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="menu-item-3">Menu Item</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="menu-item-4">Menu Item</Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="menu-item-5">Menu Item</Menu.Item>
    </Menu.Content>
  </Menu.Root>
);
```

**Action List**

Include icons, offer tips or shortcuts, color coding for semantic clues, and
sectioning. For options 5 or fewer, a search is not needed.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger asChild>
      <Button variant="solid" colorPalette="primary">
        <Icons.FolderOpen />
        File Menu
      </Button>
    </Menu.Trigger>
   <Menu.Content>
      <Menu.Item id="duplicate">
        <Icon slot="icon"><Icons.ContentCopy /></Icon>
        <Text slot="label">Duplicate</Text>
        <Kbd slot="keyboard">⌘T</Kbd>
      </Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="rename">
        <Icon slot="icon"><Icons.Create /></Icon>
        <Text slot="label">Rename</Text>
        <Kbd slot="keyboard">⌘R</Kbd>
      </Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="share">
        <Icon slot="icon"><Icons.IosShare /></Icon>
        <Text slot="label">Share</Text>
        <Kbd slot="keyboard">⌘W</Kbd>
      </Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="pin">
        <Icon slot="icon"><Icons.PushPin /></Icon>
        <Text slot="label">Pin</Text>
        <Kbd slot="keyboard">⌘P</Kbd>
      </Menu.Item>
      <Separator />
      <Menu.Item id="delete" isCritical>
        <Icon slot="icon"><Icons.Delete /></Icon>
        <Text slot="label">Delete</Text>
        <Kbd slot="keyboard">⌘D</Kbd>
      </Menu.Item>
    </Menu.Content>
  </Menu.Root>
);
```

**Section List**

Lets the user perform a one time action. Features optional section titles and
descriptions. For options 5 or fewer, a search is not needed.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger asChild>
      <Button variant="outline" colorPalette="primary">
        Actions
      </Button>
    </Menu.Trigger>
    <Menu.Content>
      <Menu.Section label="Import">
        <Menu.Item id="import-csv">Import from CSV</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item id="import-drive">Import from Drive</Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Section>
      <Separator />
      <Menu.Section label="Export">
        <Menu.Item id="export-csv">Export to CSV</Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item id="export-drive">Export to Drive</Menu.Item>
      </Menu.Section>
    </Menu.Content>
  </Menu.Root>
);
```

**Custom content**

Provide a different experience to suit what your user needs within a popover.
Make sure that this content is best suited for smaller areas. Options are very
customizable to suit your needs.

## Usage

Menus are essential to hold actions and tools in a compact and handy area of the
UI for a user. Make sure to use them correctly to allow the user to work more
efficiently and not to overwhelm. Recognizing experience patterns in your
product will also help in creating successful interactions for your users.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Short, actionable lists:** Lists of options for filtering, sorting, or
  selecting specific actions. Menu items that are clearly labeled and easily
  understood.
- **Simple form elements:** Basic form inputs like radio buttons or checkboxes
  for quick selections.
- **Contextual actions:** Actions related to the item or element that triggered
  the dropdown. Quick links to related settings or preferences.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Long paragraphs of text:** Menus are not suitable for displaying large
  amounts of text. Keep content concise and focused.
- **Complex forms or interactions:** Avoid placing complex forms or multi-step
  processes within a menu dropdown. These should be handled on dedicated pages
  or modals.
- **Critical information:** Do not rely on menu dropdown to display essential
  information that users need to see immediately. Important content should be
  readily visible on the page.
- **Unrelated content:** Ensure that the content of the menu is directly related
  to the trigger element. Avoid including unrelated or irrelevant information.
- **Nested dropdown:** Nested drop down within menu can be confusing and
  difficult to navigate.
- **Content that changes the page layout:** Avoid content that will cause the
  page to reflow when the menu opens.

### Solid-styled widths

These placements are more regular, they have either a maximum width of 268px or
form wide. The menu width should match the width of the field itself.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - The form is at maximum size (when not in a full page form) and the menu
>   matches the width of the field.
> - Longer options flow to the next lines, and when chosen, those longer texts
>   are truncated so the user can still see the icons clearly.

![](/images/menu/menu-width-do.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not have different widths for select inputs.
> - Do not change the width of the field to match the content once selected.

### Icons within action lists

Having icons can make actions easier for a user to select quickly, especially
for common and repetitive actions across products. Make sure to keep aligned
with familiar patterns to ensure user recognition. Actions can also be organized
with sections.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use common icons and clear and concise labels that are easily understood by
>   users.
> - Use destructive-styled icons for the actions that apply.

![](/images/menu/menu-icons-do.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not use uncommon icons, and do not shorten labels of actions unless it is
>   common and user tested.
> - Do not use destructive styled actions for actions that are not destructive

![](/images/menu/menu-icons-dont.png)

### Keep menu items concise

Keep menu items short and concise. Long menu items that cause text to wrap
multiple lines are discouraged. If text wrapping becomes a frequent concern,
consider revising the text or use alternative UI patterns that will give your
content more space.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use a short and easily understandable label. Describe, do not use labels as
>   instructions.
> - Text can flow to three lines, but truncate further text.

![](/images/menu/menu-concise-do.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Keep content short or make sure that the location has enough room to display
>   content with more space.
> - Don’t use additional labels or explainers when unneeded.
> - Do not encourage lengthly text for drop down experiences. Text can flow to
>   three lines, but truncate further text.
> - Punctuation is not needed.

### Organize dropdown content when possible

Use grouping structures if all items in a list can be grouped for a better user
experience. By default, organize by alphabetical order.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use labels within popover/drop downs to organize content.
> - If actions lists become bulky and hard to scan, consider another experience
>   for the user.

![](/images/menu/menu-organize-do.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't bury frequently used actions within a dropdown or menu; instead,
>   prioritize them at the top and group related actions together to facilitate
>   quick user selection.

## Accessibility

A dropdown popover is a temporary, compact list of options or actions that
appears on user interaction, designed for quick selections and efficient
navigation.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Menu.Root>
    <Menu.Trigger asChild>
      <Button variant="solid" colorPalette="primary">
        <Icons.FolderOpen />
        File Menu
      </Button>
    </Menu.Trigger>
   <Menu.Content>
      <Menu.Item id="duplicate">
        <Icon slot="icon"><Icons.ContentCopy /></Icon>
        <Text slot="label">Duplicate</Text>
        <Kbd slot="keyboard">⌘T</Kbd>
      </Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="rename">
        <Icon slot="icon"><Icons.Create /></Icon>
        <Text slot="label">Rename</Text>
        <Kbd slot="keyboard">⌘R</Kbd>
      </Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="share">
        <Icon slot="icon"><Icons.IosShare /></Icon>
        <Text slot="label">Share</Text>
        <Kbd slot="keyboard">⌘W</Kbd>
      </Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item id="pin">
        <Icon slot="icon"><Icons.PushPin /></Icon>
        <Text slot="label">Pin</Text>
        <Kbd slot="keyboard">⌘P</Kbd>
      </Menu.Item>
      <Separator />
      <Menu.Item id="delete" isCritical>
        <Icon slot="icon"><Icons.Delete /></Icon>
        <Text slot="label">Delete</Text>
        <Kbd slot="keyboard">⌘D</Kbd>
      </Menu.Item>
    </Menu.Content>
  </Menu.Root>
);
```

### Accessibility standards

**Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure users can open, navigate (arrow keys), select
(Enter/Space), and close (Esc) the menu using only the keyboard.

**ARIA Roles & States:** Properly apply ARIA roles (e.g., role="menu",
role="menuitem", aria-haspopup") and states (e.g., aria-expanded, aria-checked)
to convey semantic meaning.

**Focus Management:** Confirm focus correctly moves into the menu when opened,
cycles within it, and returns to the trigger when closed.

**Contrast & Visibility:** Verify sufficient color contrast for menu items and a
clear visual focus indicator for selected/hovered items.
