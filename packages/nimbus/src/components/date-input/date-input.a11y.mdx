## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <DateInput aria-label="Enter a date" />
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- Ensure the input field has a clear, descriptive label that is programmatically
  associated with the input element.
- The component should be fully operable using a keyboard.
- The focus order must be logical and predictable.
- The component should be compatible with screen readers, announcing its
  purpose, state, and any validation errors.
- Error messages should be clearly linked to the input field they refer to and
  be announced by screen readers.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for text and other visual elements to
  ensure readability.
- The input field and any interactive elements should have large enough touch
  targets for mobile users.
- The date format should align with the user's regional settings and be easily
  understandable.
- Use appropriate autocomplete attributes, such as birthday, to assist users and
  improve form-filling.
