# Date input

A date input component allows users to enter a specific date.

## Overview

The date input field uses a conventional date format, such as mm/dd/yyyy, which is localized based on the user's region. Users can type a date directly into the field. The component automatically formats the input as the user types.

### Accessibility standards
- Ensure the input field has a clear, descriptive label that is programmatically associated with the input element.
- The component should be fully operable using a keyboard. 
- The focus order must be logical and predictable.
- The component should be compatible with screen readers, announcing its purpose, state, and any validation errors.
- Error messages should be clearly linked to the input field they refer to and be announced by screen readers.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for text and other visual elements to ensure readability.
- The input field and any interactive elements should have large enough touch targets for mobile users.
- The date format should align with the user's regional settings and be easily understandable.
- Use appropriate autocomplete attributes, such as birthday, to assist users and improve form-filling.
