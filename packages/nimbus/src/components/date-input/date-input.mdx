# Date input

A date input component allows users to enter a specific date.

## Overview

The date input field uses a conventional date format, such as mm/dd/yyyy, which is localized based on the user's region. Users can type a date directly into the field. The component automatically formats the input as the user types.

```

**Small**

```jsx-live
const App = () => <DateInput size="sm" aria-label="Enter a date"/>
```

## Guidelines
Date input guidelines establish a standardized approach for creating intuitive and accessible date input components, ensuring consistency in presentation and interaction for selecting dates across all applications.

### Best practices

- **Use a clear placeholder.** Provide a placeholder in a conventional date format to guide the user (e.g., mm/dd/yyyy).
- **Provide clear validation.** Offer clear, concise error messages for incorrect or invalid input.
- **Format automatically.** Format the date as the user types to reduce errors and improve usability.
- **Use for specific dates.** Use this component when a user needs to enter a known date. Avoid using it for date ranges or when a calendar view would be more beneficial.
- **Ensure accessibility.** The input field will have a clear accessible label and be compatible with screen readers.

### Usage
A date input component allows users to enter a specific date. The component provides a single input field for manual entry. Use this component when a calendar selection is unnecessary or when a user is likely to know the specific date they need to enter.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Entering a known date.** Use when the user knows the specific date, such as a birth date, an expiration date, or a past event.
- **A calendar is not necessary.** Use when a calendar popover would be an unnecessary step for the user, simplifying the user experience.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Selecting a date range.** Do not use a single date input to select a start and end date. Use a date range picker instead.
- **Choosing an unknown date.** Avoid using this component when the user needs to browse or select a date they don't already know, such as setting a date for promotion or setting a range for expecting for a shipment. In these cases, a calendar popover is more effective.

### Basic interactions

Clear labels and concise messaging are crucial for a date input to ensure users understand what date information is required and how to provide it correctly.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do provide a clear placeholder in a conventional date format.
> - Do automatically format the date as the user types.
> - Do provide validation and clear error messages.
> - Do use this component when a user needs to enter a known, specific date.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <FormField.Root>
    <FormField.Label>Birth Date</FormField.Label>
    <FormField.Input>
      <DateInput aria-label="Birth date" />
    </FormField.Input>
  </FormField.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Don't use a generic placeholder like "enter date."
> - Don't require the user to manually enter separators like "/" or "-".
> - Don't allow invalid dates to be submitted without feedback.
> - Don't use this component when a calendar selection would be more helpful or when selecting a date range.

### Properties

<GroupedPropsTable componentName="DateInput"/>

### Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <DateInput aria-label="Enter a date" />
);
```

### Accessibility standards
- Ensure the input field has a clear, descriptive label that is programmatically associated with the input element.
- The component should be fully operable using a keyboard. 
- The focus order must be logical and predictable.
- The component should be compatible with screen readers, announcing its purpose, state, and any validation errors.
- Error messages should be clearly linked to the input field they refer to and be announced by screen readers.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for text and other visual elements to ensure readability.
- The input field and any interactive elements should have large enough touch targets for mobile users.
- The date format should align with the user's regional settings and be easily understandable.
- Use appropriate autocomplete attributes, such as birthday, to assist users and improve form-filling.
