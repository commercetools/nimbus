## Guidelines

Date input guidelines establish a standardized approach for creating intuitive
and accessible date input components, ensuring consistency in presentation and
interaction for selecting dates across all applications.

### Best practices

- **Use a clear placeholder.** Provide a placeholder in a conventional date
  format to guide the user (e.g., mm/dd/yyyy).
- **Provide clear validation.** Offer clear, concise error messages for
  incorrect or invalid input.
- **Format automatically.** Format the date as the user types to reduce errors
  and improve usability.
- **Use for specific dates.** Use this component when a user needs to enter a
  known date. Avoid using it for date ranges or when a calendar view would be
  more beneficial.
- **Ensure accessibility.** The input field will have a clear accessible label
  and be compatible with screen readers.

### Usage

A date input component allows users to enter a specific date. The component
provides a single input field for manual entry. Use this component when a
calendar selection is unnecessary or when a user is likely to know the specific
date they need to enter.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Entering a known date.** Use when the user knows the specific date, such as
  a birth date, an expiration date, or a past event.
- **A calendar is not necessary.** Use when a calendar popover would be an
  unnecessary step for the user, simplifying the user experience.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Selecting a date range.** Do not use a single date input to select a start
  and end date. Use a date range picker instead.
- **Choosing an unknown date.** Avoid using this component when the user needs
  to browse or select a date they don't already know, such as setting a date for
  promotion or setting a range for expecting for a shipment. In these cases, a
  calendar popover is more effective.

### Basic interactions

Clear labels and concise messaging are crucial for a date input to ensure users
understand what date information is required and how to provide it correctly.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do provide a clear placeholder in a conventional date format.
> - Do automatically format the date as the user types.
> - Do provide validation and clear error messages.
> - Do use this component when a user needs to enter a known, specific date.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <FormField.Root>
    <FormField.Label>Birth Date</FormField.Label>
    <FormField.Input>
      <DateInput aria-label="Birth date" width="1/3" />
    </FormField.Input>
  </FormField.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't use a generic placeholder like "enter date."
> - Don't require the user to manually enter separators like "/" or "-".
> - Don't allow invalid dates to be submitted without feedback.
> - Don't use this component when a calendar selection would be more helpful or
>   when selecting a date range.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <FormField.Root isInvalid>
    <FormField.Input>
      <DateInput aria-label="Date" width="1/3" />
    </FormField.Input>
    <FormField.Error>Your date is not a valid input</FormField.Error>
  </FormField.Root>
);
```
