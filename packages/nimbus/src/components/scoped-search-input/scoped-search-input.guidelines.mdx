## Guidelines

Scoped search guidelines establish how the component is used to manage
multi-domain data, ensuring consistency and accessibility in defining the search
context.

### Best practices

- **Set a smart default**: Choose the default scope that will be used by the
  vast majority of users. This saves the user an extra click most of the time.
- **Instant application of scope**: When the user changes the scope (e.g.,
  switches from "All" to "Orders"), that choice should be applied immediately
  without requiring the user to re-type the search query.
- **Default scope clarity**: Always define a clear, logical default scope (e.g.,
  "All" or the most common category) and clearly display it before the user
  interacts with the component.
- **Persistent scope**: Ensure the scope selector remains visible and accessible
  next to the input field, clearly communicating the current search context at
  all times.
- **Intuitive scope options**: Keep scope options concise and meaningful to the
  area that they are being placed in.
- **Display results contextually**: When the search results page loads,
  reiterate the search parameters clearly: "Showing 15 results for 'Jackets'
  within the 'Products' scope."
- **Handle zero results gracefully**: If the user selects a very narrow scope
  and gets zero results, suggest alternative, broader scopes they can try
  without leaving the current page.
- **Clear iconography**: If the scope selector uses icons, ensure they are
  universally understood and directly relate to the content they filter.

### Usage

The scoped search component is used to enable users to perform precise searches
by filtering the query to a specific, predefined domain or content area, leading
to more relevant results.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Multi-domain data**: When the application contains large, distinct data
  types that users often need to query separately (e.g., searching for "Jackets"
  within Products vs. searching for "Jackets" within Customers).
- **Precision is key**: When users require highly precise results and filtering
  the search domain reduces irrelevant noise (common in back-office solutions).
- **Restricted permissions**: To restrict searches based on user permissions
  (e.g., a manager can search "All Teams," but a team member can only search "My
  Team").

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Homogeneous data**: When all data belongs to a single, unified domain and
  scoping would offer minimal benefit (e.g., searching within a simple, short
  blog archive).
- **Global search default**: If the vast majority of users always search
  "everything," avoid forcing them to define a scope. A single global search
  with filters applied after the results load is often better.
- **Limited screen space**: If screen real estate is minimal, avoid the
  dual-component structure of scoped search; consider a single input with
  filtering options revealed on search results page.

### Scoped search do's and don'ts

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Ensure the scope selector is accessible and its current state is conveyed
>   via ARIA.
> - Use concise labels for scope options, the short and descriptive is best.
> - Do set a smart default for scopes.

```jsx live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState({ text: '', option: 'all' });

  const options = [
    { label: 'All fields', value: 'all' },
    { label: 'Products', value: 'products' },
    { label: 'Customers', value: 'customers' },
  ];

  return (
    <ScopedSearchInput
      value={value}
      onValueChange={setValue}
      onSubmit={(val) => console.log('Search:', val)}
      options={options}
      searchPlaceholder="Search..."
    />
  );
};
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't use confusing or abstract icons for scopes
> - Don't reset the scope back to the default after every search or page
>   refresh.
> - Don't mix global and scoped results.
> - Don't offer too many scopes.
> - Don't force users to select a scope, determine a reasonable default for
>   users.
> - Don't use highly technical or internal terms for scope labels (e.g.,
>   "Database Table A" instead of "Products").

```jsx live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState({ text: '', option: 'complex-query' });

  const options = [
    { label: 'Products that were published in the last month but no other time', value: 'complex-query' },
    { label: 'Categories', value: 'categories' },
    { label: 'Products not published this month', value: 'not-published' },
    { label: 'Products published by Kevin that have been recalled in May', value: 'oh-kevin' },
  ];

  return (
    <ScopedSearchInput
      value={value}
      onValueChange={setValue}
      onSubmit={(val) => console.log('Search:', val)}
      options={options}
      searchPlaceholder="Search..."
    />
  );
};
```
