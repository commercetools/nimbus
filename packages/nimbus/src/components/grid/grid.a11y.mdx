## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Grid templateColumns="repeat(3, 1fr)" gap="400">
    <Box bg="gray.100" p="400">Item 1</Box>
    <Box bg="gray.100" p="400">Item 2</Box>
    <Box bg="gray.100" p="400">Item 3</Box>
  </Grid>
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Use semantic HTML:** Grid is a layout component that renders a `div` by
  default. Use the `as` prop to apply semantic elements when appropriate.
- **Maintain reading order:** Ensure the visual grid order matches the DOM order
  so screen readers navigate content logically.
- **Avoid layout-only containers:** When possible, apply grid styles directly to
  semantic elements rather than wrapping content in non-semantic divs.
- **Responsive design:** Ensure grid layouts adapt appropriately for different
  screen sizes and zoom levels.
- **Focus order:** Ensure keyboard focus follows a logical order through grid
  items.
- **Don't rely on visual position alone:** Important relationships or
  information should be conveyed through semantic HTML, not just visual
  positioning.
