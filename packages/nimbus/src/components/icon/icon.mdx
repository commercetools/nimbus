#### Predefined sizes

The `Icon` component comes with a set of predefined sizes that can be applied
using the `size` prop.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="400" alignItems="center">
    <Icon size="2xs"><Icons.SentimentSatisfied /></Icon>
    <Icon size="xs"><Icons.SentimentSatisfied /></Icon>
    <Icon size="sm"><Icons.SentimentSatisfied /></Icon>
    <Icon size="md"><Icons.SentimentSatisfied /></Icon>
    <Icon size="lg"><Icons.SentimentSatisfied /></Icon>
    <Icon size="xl"><Icons.SentimentSatisfied /></Icon>
  </Stack>
);
```

#### Custom size

You can apply a custom size to the `Icon` using the `boxSize` style prop.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Icon boxSize="3200"><Icons.SentimentSatisfied /></Icon>;
```

## Guidelines

Icon guidelines establish principles for designing and using consistent,
recognizable, and accessible graphical symbols. They ensure icons clearly convey
meaning, maintain visual harmony, and function effectively across various
contexts and screen sizes while adhering to accessibility standards.

### Best practices

- **Clarity & Recognition:**
  - **Be intuitive:** Design icons that are instantly recognizable and clearly
    convey their meaning without needing extensive explanation.
  - **Supplement with text:** If an icon's meaning might be ambiguous, pair it
    with a text label, especially for critical actions.
- **Consistency & Style:**
  - **Maintain visual harmony:** Ensure all icons adhere to a consistent visual
    style (e.g., line weight, fill vs. outline, corner radius, perspective).
  - **Use consistently:** Always use the same icon to represent the same action
    or concept throughout the entire product.
  - **Ensure proper alignment:** Pay attention to pixel grid alignment for
    crispness, especially at smaller sizes.
- **Usability & Interaction:**
  - **Provide clear states:** Ideally, if using an icon as an interactive
    element, use the [Icon button](components/inputs/iconbutton) to enable
    distinct visual states (e.g., hover, focus, active, disabled).
  - **Ensure sufficient target size:** Make clickable icons large enough for
    easy interaction, especially on touch devices (minimum 44x44px target area).
- **Accessibility:**
  - **Always provide text alternatives:** Use alt text for `<img>` tags or
    aria-label for interactive SVG icons to convey their meaning to screen
    readers.
  - **Ensure sufficient contrast:** Verify that icons have enough color contrast
    against their background.
  - **Don't rely solely on icons:** Critical information should not be conveyed
    only by an icon; always have a text equivalent or context.
- **Scalability & Optimization:**
  - **Design for scalability:** Create icons in a vector format (like SVG) to
    ensure they look sharp at any size.
  - **Optimize performance:** Minimize icon file sizes to ensure fast loading
    times.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **To supplement text labels:** When paired with text, icons enhance
  comprehension, add visual interest, and aid scannability, especially for
  common actions (e.g., a "Save" icon next to the word "Save").
- **For universally recognized actions:** When an icon's meaning is clear
  without any text label (e.g., "Print," "Search," "Home," "Trash/Delete").
  These are excellent for saving space.
- **To indicate state or status:** Showing the status of an item (e.g., a "lock"
  icon for private, an "eye" icon for visible, a "check" icon for completed).
- **For brand recognition & aesthetics:** To reinforce brand identity or add a
  consistent visual style where the icon is purely decorative or supplementary
  to already clear text.
- **In space-constrained areas:** In toolbars, navigation bars, or other areas
  where screen real estate is minimal, provided the icons are highly intuitive.
- **To aid users with reading/language difficulties:** Icons can serve as
  powerful visual cues for users who struggle with text-heavy interfaces or who
  are not fluent in the interface's language.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **As the sole indicator for ambiguous actions:** If an icon's meaning isn't
  immediately obvious or could be misinterpreted, do not use it without a text
  label or a tooltip. This is a common accessibility and usability pitfall.
- **For critical information without redundancy:** Never rely only on an icon to
  convey crucial information (e.g., an error, a warning) that a user must
  understand. Always pair it with text or color.
- **Over-decorating:** Using too many icons purely for aesthetic reasons can
  lead to visual clutter and distract users from important content or actions.
- **Inconsistent usage:** Using the same icon for different meanings in
  different parts of the application, or different icons for the same meaning.
  This creates confusion.
- **Unscalable or low-resolution icons:** Using raster images that pixelate when
  scaled up, or icons that lose clarity at small sizes.
- **Overly complex or detailed icons:** Icons should be simple and easy to
  understand at a glance. Too much detail makes them hard to interpret,
  especially at smaller sizes.
- **Obscuring important content:** Placing icons in a way that blocks or
  detracts from the main content.
- **Neglecting accessibility attributes:** Not providing alt text or aria-labels
  for icons used as interactive elements or conveying meaning, leaving screen
  reader users without context.

## Properties

<PropsTable id="Icon" />

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Icon size="xs"><Icons.SentimentSatisfied /></Icon>;
```

### Accessibility Standards

Icons can be a powerful bridge for merchants navigating interfaces with reading,
language, attention, or low vision challenges. For those icons appearing without
accompanying text, however, developers must proactively apply an
`accessibilityLabel` prop to provide an `aria-label`, spoken description that
screen readers can convey to users.
