## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Icon size="xs"><Icons.SentimentSatisfied /></Icon>;
```

### Accessibility standards

Icons can be a powerful bridge for merchants navigating interfaces with reading,
language, attention, or low vision challenges. For those icons appearing without
accompanying text, however, developers must proactively apply an
`accessibilityLabel` prop to provide an `aria-label`, spoken description that
screen readers can convey to users.
