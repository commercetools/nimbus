## Guidelines

Use the Flex component strategically to create flexible and responsive layouts.

### Best practices

- **Use for flexible layouts**: Flex is ideal when you need items to grow,
  shrink, or align dynamically
- **Consider Stack first**: For simple vertical or horizontal stacking with
  consistent spacing, Stack may be simpler
- **Leverage responsive props**: Use responsive values for direction, alignment,
  and other properties
- **Combine with other layout components**: Flex works well with Box, Stack, and
  Grid for complex layouts

### When to use

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Dynamic layouts**: When items need to grow or shrink based on available
  space
- **Complex alignment**: When you need precise control over item alignment
- **Responsive designs**: When layout needs to change based on viewport size
- **Flexible spacing**: When items should distribute space dynamically

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Simple stacking**: Use Stack instead for basic vertical/horizontal layouts
  with consistent spacing
- **Grid layouts**: Use Grid for two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns
- **Static layouts**: Use Box when flexbox features aren't needed
