## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => {
  const [val, setVal] = useState('Input value');

  return (
    <FormField.Root isRequired>
      <FormField.Label>Label</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <TextInput width="full" value={val} onChange={(v)=>setVal(v)} placeholder="Enter something..." />
      </FormField.Input>
      <FormField.Description>Help Text</FormField.Description>
      <FormField.InfoBox>
        Info box content.
      </FormField.InfoBox>
    </FormField.Root>
  )
}
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Non-text content:** Provide text alternatives for any non-text content
  within or associated with form fields (e.g., icons, images). Use alt text for
  images and provide text equivalents for other non-text content.
- **Info and relationships:** Use the `<label>` element to programmatically
  associate labels with form fields. Ensure that assistive technologies can
  determine the relationship between labels and their corresponding inputs.
- **Group related fields:** Group related form fields using `<fieldset>` and
  provide a `<legend>` to create logical sections.
- **ARIA attributes:** Use ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-describedby`,
  `aria-labelledby`) to establish relationships between form fields and related
  elements.
- **Use of color:** Avoid relying solely on color to convey information or
  indicate the state of form fields (e.g., required fields, error states).
  Provide redundant visual cues, such as icons, text, or patterns, to supplement
  color-based indicators.
- **Color contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between form field
  labels, input fields, borders, and background colors. Use a contrast checking
  tool to verify that the contrast ratio meets the minimum requirements.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** Make all form field functionality operable using
  the keyboard. Enable users to navigate between form fields using the Tab key.
  Allow users to activate form field controls (e.g., buttons, checkboxes, radio
  buttons) using the Spacebar or Enter key. Ensure that keyboard focus is not
  trapped within form fields.
- **Focus visible:** Provide a clear and visible focus indicator for form fields
  when they receive keyboard focus. Visually distinguish the focus state from
  the default state using outlines, highlights, or other visual cues. Avoid
  relying solely on color changes to indicate focus.
- **On focus:** Prevent form fields from unexpectedly changing the context of
  the page when they receive focus. Ensure that any context changes are
  initiated by user actions, such as submitting the form.
- **Error identification:** Identify and describe input errors in text when they
  are automatically detected. Display clear and concise error messages near the
  corresponding form fields.
- **Labels or instructions:** Provide clear, concise, and descriptive labels or
  instructions for all form fields. Write labels that accurately reflect the
  purpose of the form fields. Provide instructions about the expected input
  format or requirements. Avoid using placeholder text as a replacement for
  visible labels.
- **Error suggestion:** If an input error is automatically detected and
  suggestions for correction are known, provide the suggestions to the user,
  unless it would jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.
- **Name, role, value:** Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<input>`,
  `<textarea>`, `<select>`) to define the role, name, and value of form fields.
  Ensure that assistive technologies can correctly interpret form fields and
  their attributes. Use ARIA attributes when necessary to provide additional
  information to assistive technologies, especially for complex or custom form
  fields.
