## Guidelines

Design guidelines offer a set of standardized rules and recommendations that
ensure consistency, usability, and accessibility across all design elements and
interactions.

Related guidelines [text-fields](#).

### Best practices

- **Clarity and simplicity:**
  - Minimize the number of fields. Only ask for essential information.
  - Use clear, concise labels that accurately describe the required input.
  - Choose what position (top or left) the labels will be and make it consistent
    in the area to help with scanning.
- **Labels:**
  - Place labels above or to the left of input fields.
  - Keep labels short and descriptive.
  - Avoid using placeholders as labels.
- **Error handling:**
  - Display error messages clearly and prominently.
  - Use specific and helpful error messages and provide suggestions for
    correcting errors.

#### Labels

For label text, use a short, catch-all description (1-3 words) of the
information that a user needs to provide. Label text that gets too long can be
overwhelming and distracting, especially in complex interactions and long forms.
Supplementary information or requirements about what to input can be shown in
help text below the field, or in a tooltip.

- **Use sentence case:** This follows our consistent style, unless statement
  contains words that are branded proper nouns.
- **Don’t add a colon (:) at the end of a field label:** The design of the
  component already communicates the relationship between the label and the
  input field.
- **Use clear and concise language:** Try to keep labels to 1-3 words. Avoid
  jargon or technical terms that the user might not understand.
- **Be specific, brief, and descriptive:** Ensure labels are easily scannable
  and reflect the function of the element. If you need instructional text, use a
  helper label beneath.
- **Avoid ambiguity:** Labels should leave no room for misinterpretation.
- **Internalization friendly:** Be aware that translation lengthens by 20% on
  average, but also avoid creating a sentence using the label combined with the
  response from a user. (e.g., Label: My favorite color is... Response...Green.
  Sentence structures between languages vary greatly.)

### Helper text vs info icon

Use the right informative tool to aid your user to understand what is needed.
See [info button](#) for more guidelines.

- **Info Button:**
  - **Complex or lengthy information:** When you need to provide more than a
    short sentence or two of explanation. By default the info button will open a
    dialog overlay. It can be used to show a tooltip on hover, but the amount of
    information a popover and a help text can contain is similar. If there is a
    want to simplify the UI, this can be used, but test to make sure that this
    information needs to be shown without interaction from a user.
  - **Progressive disclosure:** To avoid cluttering the form with too much text
    upfront, revealing details only when the user actively seeks them.
  - **Contextual help:** When the help information is very specific to a
    particular field or a user's current state within the form.  
- **Help Text:**
  - **Short, concise explanations:** For simple clarifications or hints about
    the expected input. Try to keep helper text below 150 characters.
  - **Formatting guidance:** To provide examples of the required format (e.g.,
    date formats, phone number patterns).
  - **Input requirements:** To specify character limits, password rules, or
    other constraints.
  - **Immediate visibility:** When it's crucial for the user to see the guidance
    without any extra action like a click or a hover to display.

### Usage

Be sure to give enough information to the user to understand the form without
being overwhelmed. Prioritize clarity and function over personality and over
explanation. To increase understanding, test your forms with users to understand
where confusion might occur.

### Formatting

Be consistent with your use of form fields label placements and size.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Have one placement for labels in the same form, and consistently choose one
>   size for the entire form.
> - Help text is used to show the user what the accepted formatting will be.
>   Placeholder text can be used when needed but help text is preferred for
>   accessibility.
> - OK to capitalize proper nouns in labels instead of using sentence case.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="400">
    <FormField.Root isRequired>
      <FormField.Label>First name</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <TextInput width="9600" />
      </FormField.Input>
    </FormField.Root>
    <FormField.Root isRequired>
      <FormField.Label>Social Security Number</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <TextInput width="9600" />
      </FormField.Input>
      <FormField.Description>
        Format: XXX-XX-XXXX
      </FormField.Description>
      <FormField.InfoBox>
        Info box content.
      </FormField.InfoBox>
    </FormField.Root>
  </Stack>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Use sentence case for labels. Do not capitalize every word.
> - Do not combine top and side labels within the form.
> - Only use description text and helper icons when it is needed.
> - Placeholder text should give hints to the user about what is expected, not
>   be used for quirky brand copy.
> - Do not mix form sizes.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="400">
    <FormField.Root size="md" isRequired>
      <FormField.Label>First Name</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <TextInput placeholder="What should we call you?" width="9600" />
      </FormField.Input>
    </FormField.Root>
    <FormField.Root direction="row" size="sm" isRequired>
      <FormField.Label>Last name</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <TextInput placeholder="What's in a name?" width="8000" />
      </FormField.Input>
    </FormField.Root>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Validation

Communicate clearly with users about how to correct form validation issues.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Have succinct reasons why the error happened for the user to correct.
> - Keep previously entered information so a user can check their work to spot
>   mistakes easier.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack>
    <FormField.Root isRequired isInvalid>
      <FormField.Label>Social Security Number (SSN)</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <TextInput value="555-55-5555" width="9600" />
      </FormField.Input>
      <FormField.Error>
        This information does not match
      </FormField.Error>
      <FormField.InfoBox>
        Info box content.
      </FormField.InfoBox>
    </FormField.Root>
  </Stack>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don’t forget to use error messaging. Convey clearly how a user can make
>   corrections to move forward through the form.
> - Don’t clear the previously input information if applicable, to help the user
>   understand the mistake, and provide the best user experience.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack>
    <FormField.Root isRequired isInvalid>
      <FormField.Label>Social Security Number (SSN)</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <TextInput placeholder="XXX-XX-XXXX" width="9600" />
      </FormField.Input>
      <FormField.InfoBox>
        Info box content.
      </FormField.InfoBox>
    </FormField.Root>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Labels

Clear labels are essential for a smooth user experience. They reduce confusion,
improve accessibility for everyone, and build user confidence by making
interfaces intuitive and easy to navigate. Simply put, clear labels mean happy
users.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Label is concise and clear.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <FormField.Root isRequired>
    <FormField.Label>First name</FormField.Label>
    <FormField.Input>
      <TextInput width="9600" placeholder="John" />
    </FormField.Input>
    <FormField.InfoBox>
      Info box content.
    </FormField.InfoBox>
  </FormField.Root>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Navigation is higher hierarchy than icon button tools, this is not a common
>   pattern.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <FormField.Root isRequired>
    <FormField.Label>What do we call you?</FormField.Label>
    <FormField.Input>
      <TextInput width="9600" placeholder="John or Johnny or Jon?" />
    </FormField.Input>
    <FormField.InfoBox>
      Info box content.
    </FormField.InfoBox>
  </FormField.Root>
)
```

### Helper text and info button

Use the right informative tool to aid your user to understand what is needed.
Help text should be short and is preferred when crucial information is needed.
Use info button when supplemental information is too long for a help text,
tooltips will by default open a dialog overlay, and can contain more detailed
information, content types and formatting. See [dialog](#) for more guidelines
concerning the content inside the modal.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Maximum of 1-2 short sentences, around 20-30 words. Keep helper text below
>   150 characters.
> - If a long explanation is needed to explain anything related to this field,
>   use the tooltip instead of the helper text.
> - A good example of balanced information. Helper text is being used to inform
>   all users without interaction. The info button contains supplementary
>   information.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack>
    <FormField.Root isRequired>
      <FormField.Label>Product discount rank</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <TextInput  width="9600" />
      </FormField.Input>
      <FormField.Description>
        Sort order values can only be a value between 1 and 2,147,483,647.
      </FormField.Description>
      <FormField.InfoBox>
        Info box content.
      </FormField.InfoBox>
    </FormField.Root>
  </Stack>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not overload help text and do not use bullet points. Keep help text below
>   150 characters.
> - If information is important for users, use the help text to show to users
>   without interaction.
> - Do not duplicate information in the help text and inside the info button.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack>
    <FormField.Root isRequired>
      <FormField.Label>Product discount rank</FormField.Label>
      <FormField.Input>
        <TextInput  width="9600" />
      </FormField.Input>
      <FormField.Description>
        Only one Product discount can be applied per product. The Sort order
        determines which Product discount applies to your product. Discounts
        with a Sort order value closer to 1 are considered first. Sort order
        values can only be a value between 0 and 1.
        <br/><br/>
        <Text fontWeight="700">For example:</Text>
        <br/>
        <Text>• Product discount 1 has a Sort order value: 0.05</Text>
        <Text>• Product discount 2 has a Sort order value: 0.07</Text>
        <Text>• Both Product discounts are active and apply to the same
        product.</Text>
        <Text>• Product discount 2 will apply and Product discount 1 will not
        because 0.07 is closer to 1 than 0.05.</Text>

      </FormField.Description>
      <FormField.InfoBox>
        Info box content.
      </FormField.InfoBox>
    </FormField.Root>
  </Stack>
)
