## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Group gap="200">
    <Button variant="solid">First</Button>
    <Button variant="outline">Second</Button>
    <Button variant="ghost">Third</Button>
  </Group>
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Use semantic grouping:** Group related elements together to provide context
  for assistive technologies.
- **Maintain logical focus order:** Ensure elements within the group follow a
  logical tab order.
- **Provide clear visual separation:** Use sufficient spacing to visually
  distinguish grouped elements.
- **Consider ARIA labeling:** For complex groups, use `aria-label` or
  `aria-labelledby` to provide descriptive names for screen readers.
