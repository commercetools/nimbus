## Accessibility

The component uses `onPress*` props to handle all user interactions—mouse
clicks, touch taps, and keyboard presses—consistently. These props (`onPress`,
`onPressStart`, `onPressEnd`, etc.) ensure a smooth and accessible experience
regardless of the user's input method or device.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <IconButton colorPalette="primary" variant="solid" onPress={() => alert('Button pressed!')}>
      <Icons.Edit />
    </IconButton>
  )
}
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Color contrast:** Ensure enough contrast between the icon and its
  background. WCAG requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphical
  elements and 4.5:1 for text. Tools like WebAIM's color contrast checker can
  help you verify this.
- **Non-text content:** Icons are considered non-text content. WCAG requires
  that all non-text content has a text alternative that serves the equivalent
  purpose. This usually means providing an alternative text (alt text) for the
  icon.
- **Visual cues:** Don't rely solely on color to convey information. Use
  additional visual cues like shapes, patterns, or text labels to ensure that
  the icon's meaning is clear to everyone, including people with color
  blindness.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** Icon buttons must be operable using a keyboard.
  Users should be able to navigate to the button using the Tab key and activate
  it using the Enter or Space key.
- **Target size:** Ensure that the icon button is large enough to be easily
  clickable, especially on touchscreens. WCAG recommends a minimum target size
  of 24x24 CSS pixels.
- **Focus indicator:** Provide a clear visual indicator when the icon button
  receives keyboard focus. This helps users understand which element is
  currently active.
- **Clear labels:** If the icon's meaning isn't universally understood, provide
  a text label or tooltip to clarify its purpose. This is especially important
  for less common icons.
- **Consistent design:** Use icons consistently throughout your website. This
  helps users learn the meaning of each icon and makes it easier for them to
  navigate your site.
- **Assistive technology compatibility:** Ensure that icon buttons are
  compatible with assistive technologies like screen readers. This often
  involves using proper HTML markup and ARIA attributes to provide semantic
  information about the button.
