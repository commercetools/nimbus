## Guidelines

Switch guidelines focus on providing a clear, accessible, and visually
consistent binary toggle for on/off states, ensuring discoverability, ease of
interaction, and proper communication of the current setting.

### Best practices

- **Labels & feedback**: Use clear labels and provide instant visual feedback on
  state changes.
- **Functionality**: Employ switches solely for binary on/off actions, avoiding
  overuse.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and proper ARIA for screen
  readers.

### Usage

- **Simple on/off settings**: When users need to toggle a single feature or
  preference between two states (e.g., "Notifications: On/Off," "Dark Mode:
  On/Off").
- **Immediate, direct control**: When users want to quickly and directly change
  a setting without navigating through menus or dialogs.
- **Visual clarity of state**: When it's important to visually represent the
  current state of a setting at a glance.
- **User preferences**: When users are setting personal preferences that are
  binary.
- **Feature toggles**: When users want to enable or disable features of an
  application.

### Mixed interaction states

Switches should represent binary options, without mixing states. Avoid use cases
that will need to represent summaries when options are mixed. Try using
checkboxes if you have many settings that are selectable.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Keep switches to binary options, simplifying for the user.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="200" alignItems="flex-start">
    <Text fontWeight="700">Notifications</Text>
    <Separator />
    <Switch>Email notifications</Switch>
    <Switch>Text notifications</Switch>
  </Stack>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - There is not an indeterminate state for switches. Do not design experiences
>   where a switch is being used to summarize mixed settings.
> - Do not excessively use switches, other options like checkboxes are
>   available.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="200" alignItems="flex-start">
    <Switch>Notifications</Switch>
    <Separator />
    <Switch defaultSelected>Email notifications</Switch>
    <Switch>Text notifications</Switch>
  </Stack>
);
```
