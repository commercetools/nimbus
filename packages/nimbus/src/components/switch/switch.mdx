# Switch

## Overview

This switch is an interactive element that provides instant visual feedback
allowing users to toggle binary options.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Size

#### Medium (md)

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Switch size="md">Label</Switch>;
```

#### Small (sm)

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Switch size="sm">Label</Switch>;
```

### Labels

#### With label

It is always good practice to have a label paired with a switch so a user knows
what is being toggled. The label responds to both switch sizes to match use
cases.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Switch>Label</Switch>;
```

#### Without visible label

You can use switch without visible label if the use is clear enough to not need
a label for the user. 

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Switch aria-label="I still need an aria-label for a11y purposes" />;
```

## Guidelines

Switch guidelines focus on providing a clear, accessible, and visually consistent
binary toggle for on/off states, ensuring discoverability, ease of interaction,
and proper communication of the current setting.

### Best practices

- **Labels & feedback**: Use clear labels and provide instant visual feedback on
  state changes.
- **Functionality**: Employ switches solely for binary on/off actions, avoiding
  overuse.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and proper ARIA for screen
  readers.

### Usage

- **Simple on/off settings**: When users need to toggle a single feature or
  preference between two states (e.g., "Notifications: On/Off," "Dark Mode:
  On/Off").
- **Immediate, direct control**: When users want to quickly and directly change a
  setting without navigating through menus or dialogs.
- **Visual clarity of state**: When it's important to visually represent the
  current state of a setting at a glance.
- **User preferences**: When users are setting personal preferences that are
  binary.
- **Feature toggles**: When users want to enable or disable features of an
  application.

### Mixed interaction states

Switches should represent binary options, without mixing states. Avoid use cases
that will need to represent summaries when options are mixed. Try using
checkboxes if you have many settings that are selectable.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Keep switches to binary options, simplifying for the user.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - There is not an indeterminate state for switches. Do not design experiences
>   where a switch is being used to summarize mixed settings.
> - Do not excessively use switches, other options like checkboxes are available.

## Properties

<GroupedPropsTable componentName="Switch"/>

## Accessibility

#### 1. Perceivable:
- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)**:
  - Ensure the switch's state and purpose are programmatically determinable. Use
    ARIA attributes like aria-checked to convey the on/off state to assistive
    technologies.
  - Associate a clear label with the switch using the `<label>` element or
    aria-label.
- **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A)**:
  - Don't rely solely on color to indicate the switch's state. Use other visual
    cues like position or icons.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)**:
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast between the switch's elements (background,
    toggle, label) and surrounding content.

#### 2. Operable:
- **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)**:
  - Make the switch fully operable via keyboard. Users should be able to focus on
    the switch using the Tab key and toggle it using the Spacebar or Enter key.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)**:
  - Provide a clear visual focus indicator when the switch receives keyboard
    focus. 

#### 3. Understandable:
- **3.2.1 On Focus (Level A)**:
  - Ensure that focusing on the switch doesn't trigger unexpected changes or
    actions.
- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)**:
  - Provide clear and concise labels that accurately describe the switch's
    function.

#### 4. Robust:
- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)**:
  - Use appropriate semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to define the switch's
    role, name, and value. This ensures compatibility with assistive
    technologies.
  - aria-checked must accurately reflect the on/off state.
