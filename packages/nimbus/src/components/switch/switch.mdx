# Switch

## Overview

This switch is an interactive element that provides instant visual feedback
allowing users to toggle binary options.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Size

#### Medium (md)

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Switch size="md">Label</Switch>;
```

#### Small (sm)

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Switch size="sm">Label</Switch>;
```

### Labels

#### With label

It is always good practice to have a label paired with a switch so a user knows
what is being toggled. The label responds to both switch sizes to match use
cases.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Switch>Label</Switch>;
```

#### Without visible label

You can use switch without visible label if the use is clear enough to not need
a label for the user. 

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Switch aria-label="I still need an aria-label for a11y purposes" />;
```

## Accessibility

#### 1. Perceivable:
- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)**:
  - Ensure the switch's state and purpose are programmatically determinable. Use
    ARIA attributes like aria-checked to convey the on/off state to assistive
    technologies.
  - Associate a clear label with the switch using the `<label>` element or
    aria-label.
- **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A)**:
  - Don't rely solely on color to indicate the switch's state. Use other visual
    cues like position or icons.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)**:
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast between the switch's elements (background,
    toggle, label) and surrounding content.

#### 2. Operable:
- **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)**:
  - Make the switch fully operable via keyboard. Users should be able to focus on
    the switch using the Tab key and toggle it using the Spacebar or Enter key.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)**:
  - Provide a clear visual focus indicator when the switch receives keyboard
    focus. 

#### 3. Understandable:
- **3.2.1 On Focus (Level A)**:
  - Ensure that focusing on the switch doesn't trigger unexpected changes or
    actions.
- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)**:
  - Provide clear and concise labels that accurately describe the switch's
    function.

#### 4. Robust:
- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)**:
  - Use appropriate semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to define the switch's
    role, name, and value. This ensures compatibility with assistive
    technologies.
  - aria-checked must accurately reflect the on/off state.
