## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => <Switch size="md">Label</Switch>;
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Info and relationships:** Ensure the switch's state and purpose are
  programmatically determinable. Use ARIA attributes like `aria-checked` to
  convey the on/off state to assistive technologies. Associate a clear label
  with the switch using the `<label>` element or `aria-label`.
- **Use of color:** Don't rely solely on color to indicate the switch's state.
  Use other visual cues like position or icons.
- **Color contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between the switch's
  elements (background, toggle, label) and surrounding content.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** Make the switch fully operable via keyboard. Users
  should be able to focus on the switch using the Tab key and toggle it using
  the Spacebar or Enter key.
- **Focus visible:** Provide a clear visual focus indicator when the switch
  receives keyboard focus.
- **On focus:** Ensure that focusing on the switch doesn't trigger unexpected
  changes or actions.
- **Labels or instructions:** Provide clear and concise labels that accurately
  describe the switch's function.
- **Name, role, value:** Use appropriate semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to
  define the switch's role, name, and value. This ensures compatibility with
  assistive technologies. `aria-checked` must accurately reflect the on/off
  state.
