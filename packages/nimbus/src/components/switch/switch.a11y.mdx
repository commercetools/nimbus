## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Switch size="md">Label</Switch>;
```

### Accessibility standards

#### 1. Perceivable:

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)**:
- Ensure the switch's state and purpose are programmatically determinable. Use
  ARIA attributes like aria-checked to convey the on/off state to assistive
  technologies.
- Associate a clear label with the switch using the `<label>` element or
  aria-label.
- **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A)**:
- Don't rely solely on color to indicate the switch's state. Use other visual
  cues like position or icons.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)**:
- Ensure sufficient color contrast between the switch's elements (background,
  toggle, label) and surrounding content.

#### 2. Operable:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)**:
- Make the switch fully operable via keyboard. Users should be able to focus on
  the switch using the Tab key and toggle it using the Spacebar or Enter key.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)**:
- Provide a clear visual focus indicator when the switch receives keyboard
  focus.

#### 3. Understandable:

- **3.2.1 On Focus (Level A)**:
- Ensure that focusing on the switch doesn't trigger unexpected changes or
  actions.
- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)**:
- Provide clear and concise labels that accurately describe the switch's
  function.

#### 4. Robust:

- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)**:
- Use appropriate semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to define the switch's role,
  name, and value. This ensures compatibility with assistive technologies.
- aria-checked must accurately reflect the on/off state.
