## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Box width="1600">
    <Separator />
  </Box>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Role attribute:** The component applies `role="separator"` to define it as a
  non-focusable, decorative divider.
- **Semantic separation:** Ensure separators genuinely aid in content
  organization for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.
- **Visual contrast:** While decorative, ensure the separator has sufficient
  contrast against its background to be perceivable by users with low vision,
  aligning with WCAG 2.1 1.4.11 for non-text contrast (3:1 contrast ratio).
