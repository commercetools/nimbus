# Separator

A separator is a visual or semantic line that groups and divides content,
establishing rhythm and hierarchy within a layout.

## Overview

Separators enhance clarity by visually breaking up content. They can be
horizontal or vertical.

### Resources

Deep dive into implementation details and access the Nimbus design library.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Label options

#### Horizontal

Horizontal separators can be used to divide content or tools. It can span the
entire page width or small areas.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Box width="1600">
    <Separator />
  </Box>
)
```

#### Vertical

Vertical separators can be used to divide columns of content or tools.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Box height="1600">
    <Separator orientation="vertical" />
  </Box>
)
```

#### Supports radix colors

The default color is `neutral` but can be customized with supported token
colors.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const customColors = ['slate', 'positive', 'teal', 'pink', 'mint'];

 return (
    <Flex height="1600" flexDirection="horizontal" gap="200">
      {customColors.map((color) => (
        <Separator key={color} orientation="vertical" colorPalette={color} />
      ))}
    </Flex>
  );
}
```

## Guidelines

Design guidelines offer a set of standardized rules and recommendations that
ensure consistency, usability, and accessibility across all design elements and
interactions.

### Best practices

- **Be subtle:** Separators should be noticeable but not visually jarring.
- **Prioritize white space:** Use separators only when white space alone is
  insufficient to define content groups.
- **Use sparingly:** Overuse of separators creates visual noise and diminishes
  their impact.
- **Place logically:** Position separators to reinforce content relationships
  and hierarchy.

### Usage

Separators help organize content and guide the user's eye.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- Separate distinct sections of content on a page.
- Divide items in a list, especially when items are similar.
- Group related components within a panel or dialog.
- Separate elements in a toolbar or navigation menu.
- Indicate where content might expand or collapse.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- Separate individual items when white space provides sufficient visual
  distinction.
- Overuse within a small area, which can lead to visual clutter.
- As a primary decorative element.
- When a component already has inherent visual separation (e.g., card borders).

## Properties

<PropsTable id="Separator" />

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Box width="1600">
    <Separator />
  </Box>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

**Role attribute:** The component applies `role="separator"` to define it as a
non-focusable, decorative divider.

**Semantic separation:** Ensure separators genuinely aid in content organization
for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.

**Visual contrast:** While decorative, ensure the separator has sufficient
contrast against its background to be perceivable by users with low vision,
aligning with WCAG 2.1 1.4.11 for non-text contrast (3:1 contrast ratio).
