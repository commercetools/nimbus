## Guidelines

Design guidelines offer a set of standardized rules and recommendations that
ensure consistency, usability, and accessibility across all design elements and
interactions.

### Best practices

- **Be subtle:** Separators should be noticeable but not visually jarring.
- **Prioritize white space:** Use separators only when white space alone is
  insufficient to define content groups.
- **Use sparingly:** Overuse of separators creates visual noise and diminishes
  their impact.
- **Place logically:** Position separators to reinforce content relationships
  and hierarchy.

### Usage

Separators help organize content and guide the user's eye.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- Separate distinct sections of content on a page.
- Divide items in a list, especially when items are similar.
- Group related components within a panel or dialog.
- Separate elements in a toolbar or navigation menu.
- Indicate where content might expand or collapse.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- Separate individual items when white space provides sufficient visual
  distinction.
- Overuse within a small area, which can lead to visual clutter.
- As a primary decorative element.
- When a component already has inherent visual separation (e.g., card borders).
