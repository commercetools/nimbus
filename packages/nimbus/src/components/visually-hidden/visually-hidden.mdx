# VisuallyHidden

Makes content accessible to screen readers but hides it visually.

## Basic Usage

Just wrap the content you want to hide visually, but keep accessible to screen
readers, with the `VisuallyHidden` component.

```jsx
const App = () => <VisuallyHidden>I am VisuallyHidden!</VisuallyHidden>;
```

## Focusable Content

If the content you want to hide visually contains focusable elements, add the
`isFocusable` property to the `VisuallyHidden` component. The content then
becomes visible if the first focusable element inside is focused with the
_keyboard_.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <VisuallyHidden isFocusable>
    <Button>I can have focus</Button>
  </VisuallyHidden>
);
```

## Inline Content

`VisuallyHidden` uses a `<div>` element by default to render into the DOM. If
you need to hide inline content, you can use the `as` prop to render a `<span>`
element instead, keeping the `html` semantics intact.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <p>
    Text that will be visible.
    <VisuallyHidden as="span">I will blend just in.</VisuallyHidden>
    Text that will be visible.
  </p>
);
```
