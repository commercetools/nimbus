## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Button>
    <Icons.Delete />
    <VisuallyHidden>Delete item</VisuallyHidden>
  </Button>
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Provide text alternatives for icons:** Use VisuallyHidden to add descriptive
  text for icon-only buttons or links that is accessible to screen readers but
  visually hidden.
- **Don't hide important content:** Only use VisuallyHidden for supplementary
  text that provides context for assistive technologies, not for essential
  information that all users need.
- **Skip links:** Use VisuallyHidden to create skip navigation links that allow
  keyboard users to bypass repetitive content.
- **Form labels:** Use for additional context in form labels when visual design
  already makes the purpose clear.
- **Accessible names:** Provide accessible names for interactive elements that
  rely on visual cues (icons, colors, shapes).
- **Maintain focus visibility:** When VisuallyHidden contains focusable elements
  (like skip links), ensure they become visible when focused.
- **Screen reader only instructions:** Use for providing specific instructions
  that screen reader users need but sighted users don't.
