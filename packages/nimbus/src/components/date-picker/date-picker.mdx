# DatePicker

A date picker is a UI component for users to input or select a specific calendar
date.

## Overview

Date picker can be simple or complex, allowing users to select a single date and
or specific times. There are two offered sizes, the default being medium for
most use cases.

### Resources

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visual options

#### Medium

```jsx-live
 const App = () => <DatePicker size="md" aria-label="Enter a date" width="1/3" />
```

#### Small

```jsx-live
 const App = () => <DatePicker size="sm" aria-label="Enter a date" width="1/3" />
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <DatePicker aria-label="Enter a date" />
```

### Accessibility standards

- Always provide a visible label for the input.
- Clearly associate the label with the input using the for attribute on the
  `<label>` and a matching id on the input element.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all elements (text, borders, icons, focus
  indicators).
- Clearly indicate the focused state.
- Support keyboard navigation:
  - Use Tab to navigate to and from the date input.
  - Use Enter or Space to open/close the date picker (if applicable).
  - Use arrow keys to navigate within the calendar grid (if a date picker is
    provided).
  - Allow users to select dates using Enter or Space.
- Communicate errors clearly, using both visual cues (e.g., color) and
  descriptive error messages.
- Provide clear instructions on the expected date format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY).
- Ensure screen readers announce the selected date and any navigation changes
  within a date picker.
- Provide an accessible way to clear the date input.
