# DatePicker

A date picker is a UI component for users to input or select a specific calendar
date.

## Overview

Date picker can be simple or complex, allowing users to select a single date and
or specific times. There are two offered sizes, the default being medium for
most use cases.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visual options

#### Medium

```jsx-live
 const App = () => <DatePicker size="md" aria-label="Enter a date" width="1/3" />
```

#### Small

```jsx-live
 const App = () => <DatePicker size="sm" aria-label="Enter a date" width="1/3" />
```

## Guidelines

Date picker guidelines establish a standardized approach for creating intuitive
and accessible date input components, ensuring consistency in presentation and
interaction for selecting dates across all applications.

### Best practices

- **Clear labeling:** Use explicit and descriptive labels that clearly indicate
  what date information is needed (e.g., "Date of Birth," "Event Date").
- **Provide format hints:** Clearly display the expected date format (e.g.,
  MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD) using placeholder text or helper text.
- **Offer multiple input methods:** Allow users to both manually type in the
  date and select it from a visual calendar picker.
- **Use input masks:** Consider using input masks to guide formatting as the
  user types, but ensure they don't hinder accessibility or flexibility.
- **Validate input:** Provide real-time validation and clear error messages for
  incorrect date formats or invalid dates.
- **Show current date:** In a calendar picker, clearly highlight the current
  date for easy reference.
- **Enable easy navigation:** Make it simple to navigate months and years within
  the calendar picker (e.g., using forward/backward buttons and year dropdown).
- **Indicate selected date:** Clearly visually distinguish the selected date in
  the calendar.
- **Handle unavailable dates:** If certain dates are unavailable (e.g., past
  dates for future events), clearly indicate them as disabled.
- **Ensure keyboard accessibility:** Make all parts of the DatePicker (input,
  calendar) navigable and operable using the keyboard.
- **Provide sufficient contrast:** Ensure adequate color contrast between text,
  icons, and background elements for accessibility.
- **Localization:** Adapt the date format and calendar display to the user's
  locale.
- **Offer preset ranges:** For date range selections, provide common presets
  like "Last week," "This month," etc.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Specific date selection required:** When users need to choose a particular
  date, such as a birthdate, appointment date, or event date.
- **Date-related tasks:** For features involving scheduling, filtering by date,
  setting deadlines, or defining date ranges.
- **Standardized input format:** To ensure users enter dates in a consistent and
  predictable format, reducing data entry errors.
- **Visual calendar navigation:** When users benefit from a visual
  representation of a calendar to navigate and select dates, especially for date
  ranges or when the day of the week is relevant.
- **Accessibility needs:** To provide an accessible alternative to manual text
  input for users with disabilities, including keyboard navigation and screen
  reader support.
- **Clear date context:** When the date is a primary piece of information and
  needs to be explicitly chosen.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Approximate or vague dates:** When the exact date is not critical, and users
  might only know a month or year (consider a select dropdown or a less specific
  input).
- **Dates far in the past or future:** For dates like birth dates, consider a
  direct text input with clear formatting hints or segmented inputs
  (month/day/year) to avoid excessive calendar navigation. However, a date
  picker can still be suitable if well-implemented with year selection.
- **Simple "today" or "now" selection:** For actions that simply require the
  current date or time, a button or automated function might be more efficient.
- **Limited screen real estate:** On very constrained interfaces, a compact text
  input with a clear format might be preferred over an expanded calendar, though
  accessibility should still be a priority.
- **High frequency of typing known dates:** If users frequently know the exact
  date they need to enter and typing is faster for them, a well-formatted text
  input with validation might be sufficient alongside (or instead of) a date
  picker. (e.g. birthdays)
- **Binary "yes/no" for date-related options:** For simple choices like "Remind
  me?" (implying the current date/time), a checkbox or switch might be more
  appropriate.

### Labels and messaging

Clear labels and concise messaging are crucial for a date input to ensure users
understand what date information is required and how to provide it correctly.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do use a clear and descriptive label (e.g., "Date of Birth," "Event Date").
> - Do provide clear formatting hints (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY) as placeholder text or
>   helper text.
> - Do validate the input and provide clear error messages for incorrect formats
>   or invalid dates.

![labels and messaging - do's](/images/date-picker/labels-and-messaging-do.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't rely solely on placeholder text for the label.
> - Don't use ambiguous date formats without clear guidance.
> - Don't fail to provide feedback on invalid input.

### Interaction and selection

The ideal date picker interaction offers a seamless experience through intuitive
calendar navigation, clear visual feedback on selection, and the flexibility of
both direct typing and visual selection to accommodate user preferences and
accessibility needs.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do highlight the current date in the calendar picker for reference.
> - Do provide a visual calendar picker for easy selection, especially for
>   non-familiar dates or date ranges.
> - Do allow manual text input as an alternative for users who prefer it or know
>   the date.
> - Do clearly indicate the selected date(s) in the calendar.
> - Do enable easy navigation between months and years in the calendar.
> - Do consider providing preset date ranges (e.g., "Last Week," "Next Month")
>   when relevant.

![interaction and selection - do's](/images/date-picker/interaction-and-selection-do.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't use it for selecting vague or non-specific timeframes (e.g., "sometime
>   next year").
> - Don't force users to only use the calendar picker if they prefer typing.
> - Don't use it for simple "today" selections where a button might suffice.
> - Don't auto-advance between date segments (day/month/year) in text input, as
>   it can hinder error correction.
> - Don't make calendar navigation cumbersome.

### Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <DatePicker aria-label="Enter a date" />
```

### Accessibility standards

- Always provide a visible label for the input.
- Clearly associate the label with the input using the for attribute on the
  `<label>` and a matching id on the input element.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all elements (text, borders, icons, focus
  indicators).
- Clearly indicate the focused state.
- Support keyboard navigation:
  - Use Tab to navigate to and from the date input.
  - Use Enter or Space to open/close the date picker (if applicable).
  - Use arrow keys to navigate within the calendar grid (if a date picker is
    provided).
  - Allow users to select dates using Enter or Space.
- Communicate errors clearly, using both visual cues (e.g., color) and
  descriptive error messages.
- Provide clear instructions on the expected date format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY).
- Ensure screen readers announce the selected date and any navigation changes
  within a date picker.
- Provide an accessible way to clear the date input.
