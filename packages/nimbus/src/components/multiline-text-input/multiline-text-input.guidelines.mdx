## Guidelines

Number input guidelines focus on clear labels, suitable ranges, easy interaction
via keyboard and buttons, and strong error handling, all while following WCAG
accessibility rules.

### Best practices

- **Labels:** Always include a concise and clear label using sentence case.
  Labels should not be hidden. In the rare case where context is sufficient and
  label can be absent, review the design with an accessibility expert.
- **Placeholder text:** Use concise placeholder text to provide an example or
  hint about the expected content. If consistent help is needed for context,
  utilize an info icon or use helper text below the field, as placeholder text
  disappears when a user interacts with the field, and some find it difficult to
  read placeholder text.
- **Initial height:** Set an appropriate initial height (min. rows) that
  accommodates the typical expected input length without requiring immediate
  scrolling or resizing
- **Maximum height:** Define a reasonable max. rows to prevent the input from
  growing excessively large and pushing other content off-screen. Once the
  maximum is reached, the content should become scrollable.
- **Resizability:** Enable resizing when users might need to view more content
  at once or prefer a larger input area. Ensure the resize handle is visually
  clear and functional.
- **Validation:**
  - Provide clear and concise error messages below the input field, replacing
    any helper text.
  - Highlight errors visually, for example, with a red border and an error icon.
  - Validate input for any specified constraints (e.g., character limits,
    required fields).

### Usage

A multi-line text input is used when users need to enter extended textual
information, providing ample space and flexibility.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- Collecting descriptions, comments, or notes.
- Allowing users to write full sentences or paragraphs.
- When the length of the expected input is variable and could range from a few
  words to multiple paragraphs.
- When the user needs to see a significant portion of their input at once.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- For single-line inputs (e.g., names, email addresses); use a single-line text
  input.
- For highly structured data that would be better handled with multiple specific
  input fields (e.g., separate fields for street, city, state).
- When character limits are very strict and a precise visual count is required
  (though character counters can be added).

### Labeling and sizing

Providing clear labels and contextual information aids users to fill out the
correct information.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do always include a label.
> - Do include helper text to guide users.
> - Do set an appropriate initial height.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <MultilineTextInput
        size="md"
        placeholder="well described placeholder"
        aria-label="Medium input"
        value="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat."
        rows={5}
    />
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don’t use for single-line inputs.
> - Don’t hide labels.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <MultilineTextInput
        size="md"
        placeholder="well described placeholder"
        aria-label="Medium input"
        value="1:30"
    />
)
```
