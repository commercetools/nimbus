## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="400">
    <Heading as="h1" size="4xl">Heading H1</Heading>
    <Heading as="h2" size="3xl">Heading H2</Heading>
    <Heading as="h3" size="2xl">Heading H3</Heading>
    <Heading as="h4" size="xl">Heading H4</Heading>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Semantic markup:** Use the correct HTML heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to
  establish a document outline, rather than relying on font styling alone.
- **Logical order:** Maintain the correct hierarchical order (e.g., `<h2>`
  follows `<h1>`, not `<h4>`).
- **Informative text:** Ensure the headline clearly describes the content that
  immediately follows it for easy scanning.
- **Contrast:** Maintain a high contrast ratio (`3:1` for large text, `4.5:1`
  for smaller/regular text) between the text and background.
- **Visual distinction:** Ensure the headline is visually distinct (size,
  weight) from body text to aid quick visual scanning.
- **Language attribute:** Use the lang attribute if the headline is in a
  language different from the rest of the page.
