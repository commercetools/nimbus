Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Calendar aria-label="Enter a date" />
```

### Accessibility standards

- Ensure the calendar is navigable using a keyboard.
- Use Tab to move focus to and from the calendar component.
- Use Enter or Space to activate controls (e.g., to open/close the calendar,
  select a date, or navigate months/years).
- Use arrow keys to navigate between days within the calendar grid.
- Ensure focus is clearly visible on the currently selected day or navigated
  day.
- Clearly indicate the current month and year.
- Provide accessible controls for navigating to previous and next months/years.
  These controls should have clear aria-label attributes if they are icon-only.
- Ensure selected dates are clearly distinguished visually and announced by
  screen readers.
- Communicate invalid or unavailable dates (e.g., past dates, blackout dates) to
  screen readers.
- Provide a mechanism for users to select a specific date (e.g., clicking a day,
  or typing a date into an associated input field).
- Announce changes in month or year to screen readers.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all calendar elements (text, borders,
  icons, selected states, hover states).
