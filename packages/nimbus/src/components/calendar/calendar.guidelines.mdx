## Guidelines

Calendar guidelines focus on creating intuitive and accessible interfaces for
viewing, navigating, and interacting with dates and events.

### Best practices

- **Clear visual hierarchy:** Distinguished between days, weeks, months, and
  years. Highlight the current date and any selected dates.
- **Intuitive navigation:** Clear controls to move between different time
  periods (days, weeks, months, years).
- **Clear labels and instructions:** Clear labels for navigation controls and
  any interactive elements within the calendar.

### Usage

A calendar is used to visually display and manage time-based information,
allowing users to view, schedule, and interact with dates. A common way this
component is used is within the popover, and paired with the date input.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Scheduling:** When users need to select specific dates and times.
- **Visualizing time-based data:** To display data or to filter data in a
  corresponding visual.
- **Browsing dates:** When users need to navigate through different days, weeks,
  or months to find a specific date or time.
- **Contextual awareness of dates:** When the day of the week or the
  relationship between dates is important for decision-making.
- **Recurring events:** To allow users to set up and manage events that repeat
  on a regular basis.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Simple date input:** If users already know the specific date (e.g., date of
  birth) and typing it in a formatted field is quicker and easier.
- **Selecting a single "today" or "now":** For actions that inherently refer to
  the current date and time, a button or automatic function is more efficient.
- **Limited screen space:** On very small interfaces, a compact date input or a
  simplified selection method might be necessary.
- **Linear processes:** For step-by-step workflows where date selection is just
  one field, a calendar might be an unnecessary interruption.
- **Non-time-related data:** For displaying or managing information that isn't
  tied to specific dates or times.

#### Keeping interactions simple

Simple calendar interactions are vital because they minimize user effort and
cognitive load, allowing for quick and efficient time management, the calendar's
primary function.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Provide clear navigation. Make it easy to move between days, weeks, months,
>   and years using intuitive controls (arrows, drop downs).
> - Ensure navigation controls are clearly labeled and their function is
>   obvious.

```jsx live
const App = () => <Calendar defaultValue={new CalendarDate(2025, 1, 15)} />;
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't over clutter. Avoid displaying too much information on the calendar
>   grid at once, which can make it overwhelming.
> - Don't make navigation confusing. Ensure navigation controls are clearly
>   labeled and their function is obvious.
> - Don't use it for simple date input. If users know the exact date, a direct
>   date input field might be more efficient.
> - Don't auto-submit on date selection. Avoid automatically submitting forms or
>   triggering actions immediately after a date is selected.
