## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Adjustable elements

Several of the features are flexible and optional for many use cases.
Non-optional elements are the message, and the icons that are tied to the type
of messaging.

#### Buttons and links

The alert component allows for two buttons and links within the paragraph
message. These buttons and links can be customized for any messaging needs.

#### Close and dismiss buttons

Features that may be used for closing or dismissing the alert message are
optional. Removing these elements will make this message persistent for the
user. There is no need to duplicate a close action, using the close icon in the
right corner or a dismiss button is enough for a user.

#### Title and description

The message is needed in all uses. Please always utilize messaging for the user.
Use of the title is optional, use if it gives greater clarity to the user.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column">
    <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined">
      <Alert.Title>Lorem Ipsum</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. <Link>Read more</Link>
      </Alert.Description>
      <Alert.Actions>
        <Stack direction="row" alignItems="center">
          <Button variant="outline">Dismiss</Button>
          <Button variant="outline">View changes</Button>
        </Stack>
      </Alert.Actions>
      <Alert.DismissButton />
    </Alert.Root>

    <Alert.Root tone="info" variant="outlined">
      <Alert.Title>Lorem Ipsum</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. <Link>Read more</Link>
      </Alert.Description>
      <Alert.DismissButton />
    </Alert.Root>

    <Alert.Root tone="warning" variant="outlined">
      <Alert.Title>Lorem Ipsum</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. <Link>Read more</Link>
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>

    <Alert.Root tone="positive" variant="outlined">
      <Alert.Description>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. <Link>Read more</Link>
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Style

#### Outlined

Use when getting attention is more important. These can be used inline, but they
take up space and it is not as easy to slide into compact areas as much the flat
variant.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Alert.Root tone="positive" variant="outlined" width="8000">
    <Alert.Title>Success! Your Account is Verified</Alert.Title>
    <Alert.Description>
      Congratulations! Your account has been successfully verified. You now have full access to all features.
    </Alert.Description>
  </Alert.Root>
)
```

#### Flat

Use for inline messages specific to a field. You can also use this in dense
areas with popovers. Do not use as a global page alert. In these placements, use
links instead of buttons if a user needs to navigate to more information.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" alignItems="start">
    <Text fontWeight="500">Email</Text>
    <TextInput type="email" />
    <Alert.Root tone="positive" variant="flat">
      <Alert.Description>
        Email is verified
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>
  </Stack>
)
```

#### Width

The width is flexible, intended for many inline placements and page wide areas.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Grid templateColumns="repeat(6, 1fr)" gap="400">
    <Grid.Item colSpan={2}>
      <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined">
        <Alert.Description>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. <Link>Read more</Link>
        </Alert.Description>
      </Alert.Root>
    </Grid.Item>

    <Grid.Item colSpan={3}>
      <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined">
        <Alert.Description>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. <Link>Read more</Link>
        </Alert.Description>
      </Alert.Root>
    </Grid.Item>

    <Grid.Item colSpan={6}>
      <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined">
        <Alert.Description>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. <Link>Read more</Link>
        </Alert.Description>
        <Alert.Actions>
          <Button variant="outline">View Changes</Button>
        </Alert.Actions>
        <Alert.DismissButton />
      </Alert.Root>
    </Grid.Item>
  </Grid>
);
```

### Tone

#### Positive

Positive alerts should be used for important updates, and product wide
announcements. They should not be used in place of toasts or confirmation
messages.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Grid templateColumns="repeat(2, 1fr)" gap="400">
    <Alert.Root tone="positive" variant="outlined">
      <Alert.Title>Success! Your Account is Verified</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        Congratulations! Your account has been successfully verified. You now have full access to all features.
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>

    <Alert.Root tone="positive" variant="flat">
      <Alert.Title>Success! Your Account is Verified</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        Congratulations! Your account has been successfully verified. You now have full access to all features.
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>
  </Grid>
);
```

#### Info

Should be used when extra explanation is needed, this alert is meant to be more
temporary than using an info icon with a tooltip which declutters persistent
information for users.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Grid templateColumns="repeat(2, 1fr)" gap="400">
    <Alert.Root tone="info" variant="outlined">
      <Alert.Title>New Feature Available</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        We've added a new 'Smart Suggestions' feature to help you find relevant content faster. <Link>Check it out in your settings.</Link>
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>

    <Alert.Root tone="info" variant="flat">
      <Alert.Title>New Feature Available</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        We've added a new 'Smart Suggestions' feature to help you find relevant content faster. <Link>Check it out in your settings.</Link>
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>
  </Grid>
)
```

#### Warning

Messages potential problems or situations that require user attention to prevent
issues. They require the user to take action to make needed corrections or
confirmation.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Grid templateColumns="repeat(2, 1fr)" gap="400">
    <Alert.Root tone="warning" variant="outlined">
      <Alert.Title>Low Storage Space</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        Your device is running low on storage. Some features may be disabled until you free up space. <Link>Manage storage.</Link>
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>

    <Alert.Root tone="warning" variant="flat">
      <Alert.Title>Low Storage Space</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        Your device is running low on storage. Some features may be disabled until you free up space. <Link>Manage storage.</Link>
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>
  </Grid>
)
```

#### Critical

These are used to message immediate, severe problems that require urgent action.
They indicate that something has already gone wrong and needs to be addressed
immediately.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Grid templateColumns="repeat(2, 1fr)" gap="400">
    <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined">
      <Alert.Title>Payment Processing Error</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        A payment processing error occurred for order #12345. Please <Link>verify your payment gateway settings</Link> immediately to prevent further issues.
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>

    <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="flat">
      <Alert.Title>Payment Processing Error</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        A payment processing error occurred for order #12345. Please <Link>verify your payment gateway settings</Link> immediately to prevent further issues.
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>
  </Grid>
)
```

## Guidelines

Alert guidelines focus on delivering important and timely messages to users in a
clear, noticeable, and accessible way, ensuring they understand the significance
of the information and any required actions, while minimizing disruption to
their workflow.

### Writing guidelines

- **Clarity and urgency:** Use clear, short messages with titles that match the
  alert's urgency, and use visuals to reinforce it.
- **User experience:** Place alerts strategically, allow dismissal when
  available, provide actionable content, and avoid overuse to prevent alert
  fatigue. Excessive and poorly designed alerts can lead to alert fatigue, a
  state of desensitization where individuals disregard or fail to act upon
  critical notifications due to overexposure, often stemming from alerts that
  are too frequent, irrelevant to the user's context, or lacking in actionable
  information.
  - **Flat styled:** Use inline in forms and within popovers when needed. These
    can be used inside forms to signal validation status.
  - **Outlined styled:** Be mindful of how many alerts occur on one page. These
    are best used for page or product wide information. They are not meant to be
    used as toasts.
- **Accessibility and design:** Maintain consistent styling, use color and icons
  effectively, and ensure alerts are accessible to all users. For example, do
  not use the information tone to communicate a critical error.

### Usage

Correct usage guides for alerts are important for we do not want to fatigue
users to a point where alert messages are ignored.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Do use alerts for important information:** Reserve alerts for critical,
  urgent, or highly relevant messages that require user attention.
- **Do choose the right alert type:** Match the alert's tone and visual style to
  the severity of the message (positive, informational, warning, critical).
- **Do provide clear and concise messages:** Write messages that are easy to
  understand and avoid jargon.
- **Do include actionable items:** If necessary, provide clear calls to action
  (buttons, links) to help users resolve the issue.
- **Do allow users to dismiss alerts:** Give users the option to dismiss alerts
  when they are no longer relevant.
- **Do place alerts strategically:** Position alerts where they are easily
  noticed but don't disrupt the user's workflow.
- **Do maintain consistency:** Use consistent styling and behavior for alerts
  across your application or website.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Don't overuse alerts:** Avoid using alerts for minor or non-essential
  information. Try to keep to one alert per view for most interactions. Overuse
  leads to alert fatigue.
- **Don't use alerts for regular updates:** Use other UI elements (e.g., toasts,
  confirmation, and error states) for non-urgent updates.
- **Don't obscure critical content:** Avoid placing alerts in a way that blocks
  important information or functionality.
- **Don't use confusing or ambiguous language:** Ensure alert messages are clear
  and easy to understand.
- **Don't create unnecessary interruptions:** Avoid using alerts that abruptly
  interrupt the user's workflow without a valid reason.
- **Don't make them too hard to dismiss:** Ensure that the user can easily close
  an alert.

### Use the correct tone

Ensure that you choose the correct tone that will suit your message best. If you
choose the wrong type, it will confuse users.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - This message correctly aligns message with the tone needed to let the user
>   know the information should be taken seriously.
> - There is enough detailed information for the user to understand the issue
>   and how to perform next steps to correct it.
> - Utilizing actionable buttons to guide the user faster to the area that needs
>   to be addressed is useful and convenient.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined">
    <Alert.Title>Payment Processing Error</Alert.Title>
    <Alert.Description>
      A payment processing error occurred for order #12345. Please <Link>verify your
      payment gateway settings</Link> immediately to prevent further issues.
    </Alert.Description>
    <Alert.Actions>
      <Button variant="outline">Go to settings</Button>
    </Alert.Actions>
  </Alert.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - This message does not align with the correct tone needed.
> - There isn’t enough information for the user to understand how to fix the
>   issue, or what went wrong. Provide more detailed information and advice to
>   clear the error.
> - This type of message is critical, rethink about allowing the user to clear
>   the message instead of fixing the issue.
> - You do not need to use both a close icon and a dismiss button.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Alert.Root tone="positive" variant="outlined">
    <Alert.Title>Payment Processing Error</Alert.Title>
    <Alert.Actions>
      <Button variant="outline">Dismiss</Button>
    </Alert.Actions>
    <Alert.DismissButton />
  </Alert.Root>
);
```

### Placements

Alerts are very flexible and can be placed in line or within pages, but be
mindful not to use alert placement to cover or mask features that a user means
to use. Judge if this message is permanent, or if it would be okay to allow the
user to dismiss the alert to clean up their experience once digesting the
information provided in the alert.

Alerts should not hover or lay on top of other elements.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Place inline where the information makes sense and is needed most without
>   covering access to surrounding elements.
> - Allow for the user to clear messages when applicable to keep their UI clean,
>   and if they find non-critical information distracting.
> - If information is needed permanently in the UI, try using another component
>   like the info icon paired with the tooltip or popover.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" width="8000">
    <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined">
      <Alert.Title>Account needs validation</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        To edit these fields you must first validate your account. Please check your email.
      </Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>
    <Text fontWeight="500">Product price mode</Text>
    <TextInput isInvalid />
  </Stack>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not use alerts for form errors, instead use error helper text that
>   populates below the field.
> - Do not cover other elements on the page with the alert.
> - Do not restrict the user from clearing messages when applicable. (Critical
>   and warning messages are more likely to be persistent. Judge if the content
>   needs to persist.)

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Box>
    <Stack direction="column">
      <Text fontWeight="500">Product price mode</Text>
      <TextInput isInvalid />
    </Stack>

   <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined" width="9600" position="relative" top="-500" left="500">
      <Alert.Title>Product price mode error</Alert.Title>
      <Alert.Description>
        This price mode has not been defined.
      </Alert.Description>
      <Alert.Actions>
        <Button variant="outline">Define price mode</Button>
      </Alert.Actions>
    </Alert.Root>
  </Box>
);
```

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - With form specific validation alerts, use the flat styled alerts. Keep
>   warnings short in these locations, and if needed, include links for users.
> - When there is more information needed, you can use flat-styled alerts within
>   popovers.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column">
    <Text fontWeight="500">Customer group</Text>
    <TextInput isDisabled />
    <Alert.Root tone="warning" variant="flat">
      <Alert.Description>You do not have access to edit this field</Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>
  </Stack>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not put error messages within info popovers, use error or alert messaging
>   that is shown to the user instead of hiding them in areas that require
>   interaction.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column">
    <Text fontWeight="500">Customer group</Text>
    <TextInput isInvalid />
    <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="flat" position="relative" top="-1000" width="8000">
      <Alert.Description>This customer group does not exist or may have been deleted. Try again.</Alert.Description>
    </Alert.Root>
  </Stack>
);
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined">
    <Alert.Title>Payment Processing Error</Alert.Title>
    <Alert.Description>
      A payment processing error occurred for order #12345. Please <Link>verify your
      payment gateway settings</Link> immediately to prevent further issues.
    </Alert.Description>
    <Alert.Actions>
      <Button variant="outline">View changes</Button>
    </Alert.Actions>
    <Alert.DismissButton />
  </Alert.Root>
);
```

### Accessibility Standards

#### 1. Perceivable:

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A):**
  - Ensure the alert's content and purpose are programmatically determinable.
    Use `ARIA` attributes like `aria-live` and `aria-atomic` to announce dynamic
    content changes to assistive technologies.
  - If the alert contains non-text content (e.g., icons), provide text
    alternatives (e.g., alt text for images).
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA):**
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast between the alert's text and background.
- **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A):**
  - Don't rely solely on color to convey the alert's meaning. Use additional
    visual cues like icons or text.

#### 2. Operable:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A):**
  - If the alert contains interactive elements (e.g., buttons), ensure they are
    keyboard operable.
  - If the alert requires dismissal, ensure it can be dismissed using the
    keyboard (e.g., Esc key).
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA):**
  - If the alert contains interactive elements, provide a clear visual focus
    indicator.

#### 3. Understandable:

- **3.2.1 On Focus (Level A):**
  - Ensure that the alert doesn't cause unexpected changes to the page or
    context.
- **3.3.1 Error Identification (Level A):**
  - If the alert indicates an error, clearly identify and describe the error in
    text.
- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A):**
  - Provide clear and concise messages that are easy to understand.

#### 4. Robust:

- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A):**
  - Use appropriate semantic `HTML` and `ARIA` attributes to define the alert's
    role, name, and value. This ensures compatibility with assistive
    technologies.
  - Use `role="alert"` or `role="alertdialog"` to define the alert.
- **4.1.3 Status Messages (Level AA):**
  - For status messages that don't interrupt the user, use `role="status"`
    instead of `role="alert"`.
