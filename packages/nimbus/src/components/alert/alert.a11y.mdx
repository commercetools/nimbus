## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Alert.Root colorPalette="critical" variant="outlined">
    <Alert.Title>Payment Processing Error</Alert.Title>
    <Alert.Description>
      A payment processing error occurred for order #12345. Please <Link>verify your
      payment gateway settings</Link> immediately to prevent further issues.
    </Alert.Description>
    <Alert.Actions>
      <Button variant="outline">View changes</Button>
    </Alert.Actions>
    <Alert.DismissButton />
  </Alert.Root>
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Info and relationships:** Ensure the alert's content and purpose are
  programmatically determinable. Use `ARIA` attributes like `aria-live` and
  `aria-atomic` to announce dynamic content changes to assistive technologies.
- **Non-text content:** If the alert contains non-text content (e.g., icons),
  provide text alternatives (e.g., alt text for images).
- **Color contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between the alert's text
  and background.
- **Use of color:** Don't rely solely on color to convey the alert's meaning.
  Use additional visual cues like icons or text.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** If the alert contains interactive elements (e.g.,
  buttons), ensure they are keyboard operable. If the alert requires dismissal,
  ensure it can be dismissed using the keyboard (e.g., Esc key).
- **Focus visible:** If the alert contains interactive elements, provide a clear
  visual focus indicator.
- **On focus:** Ensure that the alert doesn't cause unexpected changes to the
  page or context.
- **Error identification:** If the alert indicates an error, clearly identify
  and describe the error in text.
- **Labels or instructions:** Provide clear and concise messages that are easy
  to understand.
- **Name, role, value:** Use appropriate semantic `HTML` and `ARIA` attributes
  to define the alert's role, name, and value. This ensures compatibility with
  assistive technologies. Use `role="alert"` or `role="alertdialog"` to define
  the alert.
- **Status messages:** For status messages that don't interrupt the user, use
  `role="status"` instead of `role="alert"`.
