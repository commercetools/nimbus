# Select input
A select input is a form field that presents users with a dropdown menu of
options to choose from.

## Overview
Select inputs have two main appearances, two sizes, and several states that will
respond to validation status. **Currently, this is a single value selector,
this will be reworked to bring in multi-select in the future.**

## Variables

 Get familiar with the features. 

### Height options

#### Medium
This is the default size for the select input.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Select.Root size="md" aria-label="Select a fruit">
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>  
)
```

#### Small
For use in areas that require more condensed styling.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Select.Root size="sm" aria-label="Select a fruit">
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>  
)
```

### Fixed width

#### Solid-styled
Max width when not in a page wide form should be 268px. If the solid-styled
select input field is inline a page wide form match popover width to match the
size of the form fields.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Select.Root aria-label="Select a fruit">
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>  
)
```

#### Ghost-styled
Hug the select-input field, this styling needs closer placement to the drop
down icon than a solid-styled version. The popover width has two options with
this placement based on content. Short content should match the hug width of
the field. Longer content should have a max width of 268px. 

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Select.Root variant="ghost" aria-label="Select a fruit">
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>  
)
```

### Text wrapping

#### Text wrapping within popover
Please encourage short text when possible. When applicable, wrap text onto
another line when needed.

#### Truncate when long line item is selected
If selected, truncate text so it does not overlap over the icons in the select
input field.

![](/images/select/truncate-when-long-line-item-is-selected.png)

### Validation

#### Default
A select input's prompting the user to make a choice without implying a specific
selection.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Select.Root aria-label="Select a fruit">
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>  
)
```

#### Invalid
Use to immediately communicate the error to the user. Utilize error text when
needed.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Select.Root aria-label="Select a fruit" isInvalid>
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>  
)
```

#### Disabled
This is the disabled state. 

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Select.Root aria-label="Select a fruit" isDisabled>
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>  
)
```

#### Placeholder
The purpose of placeholder text is to provide a clear prompt or instruction,
guiding the user on what action is expected.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Select.Root placeholder="Select a fruit" aria-label="Select a fruit">
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>  
)
```

## Guidelines

Design guidelines offer a set of standardized rules and recommendations that
ensure consistency, usability, and accessibility across all design elements and
interactions.

### Best practice

- **Include a label:** Give the users context on what is being asked for when
  making a selection. A picker without a label is ambiguous and not accessible.
  Use “Select” or “Search and select” as a default placeholder label wording.  
  - In rare cases where context is sufficient to not need a label, these
    placements should still be given an aria-label in HTML. 
  - **Placeholders:** Should function as a prompt not a value. Do not use a
    placeholder as a label.   
- **Keep contents concise:** Long menu items that wrap to multiple lines should
  be kept to a minimum. If this becomes a frequent concern, consider an
  alternate UI component or pattern to allow for more breathing room for
  content.
- **Organize content:** The default organization is alphabetical, if a user
  benefits from better organization please improve their experience with better
  categories. 
- **Include help text when needed:** If more information is needed to provide
  context, include helper text below the field for the user. Replace helper text
  with error text if applicable and needed.
- **Don't neglect ARIA attributes:** If you are building a custom select input,
  ensure that you use proper ARIA attributes to make the select box accessible
  to screen readers.

#### When to use a solid vs. ghost styled select input

| **Type**    | **Use this instead** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Solid-style** | <ul><li>The default option to use in forms.</li><li>Typically the best experience to use with content created by a user.</li><li>When you want to include search for the content.</li></ul>                |
| **Ghost-style** | <ul><li>The default option to use to filter or build rules around content. Ex: filtering assets for the user.</li><li>Best used within rule building experiences such as discounts.</li><li>Ideal to be used in condensed areas, with condensed and familiar options for the user, as in simple filters or quick actions like “delete”.</li></ul> |

### Usage

Select inputs are common and users are familiar with their uses. Keeping
consistent with the guidelines will help our products intuitive and easy to
understand, even through complicated areas. 

### Solid-styled widths

These placements are more regular, they have either a maximum width of 268px
or form wide. The popover width should match the width of the field itself. 

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - The form is at maximum size (when not in a pull page form) and the popover
>   matches the width of the field. 
> - Longer options flow to the next lines, and when chosen, those longer texts
>   are truncated so the user can still see the icons clearly. 

![](/images/select/solid-styled-widths.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Do not have different widths for select inputs.
> - Do not change the width of the field to match the content once selected.

![](/images/select/solid-styled-widths-dont.png)

### Ghost-styled widths
There are a few differences that ghost-styled select inputs have that aren't
needed with solid-style placements. Ghost-styled fields should hug width, with
popovers having a min width matching the field, and max width being 268px unless
on a page wide form.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Select input field width set to “hug” with max width popover at 268px.
> - Content flows to next line when needed.

![](/images/select/ghost-styled-widths.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - This drop down icon looks like it is not related to the select input field.
> - Do not truncate options that should flow to the next line. 

![](/images/select/ghost-styled-widths-dont.png)

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - With short selectable content, match content width to match the select
>   input “hug” width.

![](/images/select/short-selectable-content.png)


> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Do not set the popover width to “hug”, this content should match the
>   width of the field.

![](/images/select/short-selectable-content-dont.png)

### Labels and preselection

Make sure to place tooltips in areas where they will be seen easily.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Use a short and easily understandable label. Describe, do not use labels
>   as instructions.
> - Use placeholder if there isn’t a most common or default choice.

![](/images/select/labels-and-preselection.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Do not rely on placeholders instead of labels.
> - Do not preselect a random option unless it's genuinely the most common
>   or default choice.

![](/images/select/labels-and-preselection-dont.png)


### Labels and layout exceptions

With the ghost styling for labels, there are some placements that can be used
without labels and have varying widths based on placement. These are most
commonly found in filters and with rule builders.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Use a short and easily understandable label.
> - Use placeholder if there isn’t a most common or default choice. 

![](/images/select/labels-and-layout-exceptions.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Try not to overuse drop downs. Do not make it unclear what parts of a
>   ghost-styled are interactive to the user. 
> - Make sure that if logic is being used that it goes through user testing
>   and is understandable for the targeted user. 

![](/images/select/labels-and-layout-exceptions-dont.png)

### Keep menu items concise

Keep menu items short and concise. Long menu items that cause text to wrap
multiple lines are discouraged. If text wrapping becomes a frequent concern,
consider revising the text or use alternative UI patterns that will give your
content more space.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Use a short and easily understandable label. Describe, do not use labels
>   as instructions.
> - Text can flow to three lines, but truncate further text.

![](/images/select/keep-menu-items-concise.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Keep content short or make sure that the location has enough room to
>   display content with more space.
> - Don’t use additional labels or explainers when unneeded. 
> - Do not encourage lengthy text for drop down experiences. Text can flow to
>   three lines, but truncate further text.

![](/images/select/keep-menu-items-concise-dont.png)

### Organize dropdown content when possible

Use grouping structures if all items in a list can be grouped for a better user
experience. By default, organize by alphabetical order.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Use labels within popover/drop downs to organize content.
> - Allow if possible for the user to search for items with type ahead fuzzy
>   search.
> - If actions lists become bulky and hard to scan, consider another experience
>   for the user.

![](/images/select/organize-dropdown-content-when-possible.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Don't bury frequently used actions within a dropdown or menu; instead,
>   prioritize them at the top and group related actions together to facilitate
>   quick user selection.

![](/images/select/organize-dropdown-content-when-possible-dont.png)


### Help and error text inclusion

Use helper text when needed, and replace helper text with error text if
triggered.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Use helper text to give more context to the select input when needed.
>   Omit if self explanatory. 
> - Error and helper text should be short and easily understood.

![](/images/select/help-and-error-text-inclusion.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Don’t show both helper text and information text simultaneously.

### Accessibility standards

#### 1. Perceivable:
- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A):**
  - Use the `<label>` element to programmatically associate a clear, descriptive label with the select input.
  - Ensure that assistive technologies can determine the relationship between the label and the select input.
  - Group related select inputs within a `<fieldset>` and provide a `<legend>` to give context to the group.
- **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A):**
  - Avoid relying solely on color to convey information or the state of the select input.
  - Ensure that other visual cues, such as the select input's appearance or a surrounding indicator, convey the necessary information.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA):**
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast exists between the select input's text, background, and border.
  - Use a contrast checking tool to verify that the contrast ratio meets the minimum requirements.
#### 2. Operable:
- **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A):**
  - Make the select input fully operable using the keyboard.
  - Allow users to navigate to the select input using the Tab key.
  - Enable users to open and close the dropdown menu using the Spacebar or Enter key.
  - Allow users to navigate through the options using the arrow keys.
  - Enable users to select an option using the Enter key.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA):**
  - Provide a clear and visible focus indicator for the select input when it receives keyboard focus.
  - Visually distinguish the focus state from the default state.
  - Avoid relying solely on color changes to indicate focus.
#### 3. Understandable:
- **3.2.1 On Focus (Level A):**
  - Prevent the select input from unexpectedly changing the context of the page when it receives focus.
  - Ensure that any changes in context are initiated by the user's selection and not simply by focusing on the input.
- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A):**
  - Provide clear and concise labels or instructions for the select input.
  - Write labels that accurately reflect the purpose of the select input.
  - Provide instructions about what kind of input is expected.
- **3.3.3 Error Suggestion (Level AA):**
  - If an input error is automatically detected and suggestions for correction are known, then provide the suggestions to the user, unless it would jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.  
#### 4. Robust:
- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A):**
  - Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<select>`, `<option>`) to define the role, name, and value of the select input.
  - Ensure that assistive technologies can correctly interpret the select input and its options.
  - Use ARIA attributes when necessary to provide additional information to assistive technologies, especially for complex select inputs or custom implementations.
