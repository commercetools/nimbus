## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Select.Root size="md" aria-label="Select a fruit">
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

#### 1. Perceivable:

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A):**
  - Use the `<label>` element to programmatically associate a clear, descriptive
    label with the select input.
  - Ensure that assistive technologies can determine the relationship between
    the label and the select input.
  - Group related select inputs within a `<fieldset>` and provide a `<legend>`
    to give context to the group.
- **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A):**
  - Avoid relying solely on color to convey information or the state of the
    select input.
  - Ensure that other visual cues, such as the select input's appearance or a
    surrounding indicator, convey the necessary information.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA):**
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast exists between the select input's text,
    background, and border.
  - Use a contrast checking tool to verify that the contrast ratio meets the
    minimum requirements.

#### 2. Operable:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A):**
  - Make the select input fully operable using the keyboard.
  - Allow users to navigate to the select input using the Tab key.
  - Enable users to open and close the dropdown menu using the Spacebar or Enter
    key.
  - Allow users to navigate through the options using the arrow keys.
  - Enable users to select an option using the Enter key.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA):**
  - Provide a clear and visible focus indicator for the select input when it
    receives keyboard focus.
  - Visually distinguish the focus state from the default state.
  - Avoid relying solely on color changes to indicate focus.

#### 3. Understandable:

- **3.2.1 On Focus (Level A):**
  - Prevent the select input from unexpectedly changing the context of the page
    when it receives focus.
  - Ensure that any changes in context are initiated by the user's selection and
    not simply by focusing on the input.
- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A):**
  - Provide clear and concise labels or instructions for the select input.
  - Write labels that accurately reflect the purpose of the select input.
  - Provide instructions about what kind of input is expected.
- **3.3.3 Error Suggestion (Level AA):**
  - If an input error is automatically detected and suggestions for correction
    are known, then provide the suggestions to the user, unless it would
    jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.  

#### 4. Robust:

- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A):**
  - Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<select>`, `<option>`) to define the
    role, name, and value of the select input.
  - Ensure that assistive technologies can correctly interpret the select input
    and its options.
  - Use ARIA attributes when necessary to provide additional information to
    assistive technologies, especially for complex select inputs or custom
    implementations.
