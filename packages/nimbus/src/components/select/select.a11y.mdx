## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Select.Root size="md" aria-label="Select a fruit">
    <Select.Options>
      <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
      <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
    </Select.Options>
  </Select.Root>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Provide clear labels:** Use the `<label>` element to programmatically
  associate a clear, descriptive label with the select input.
- **Group related inputs:** Group related select inputs within a `<fieldset>`
  and provide a `<legend>` to give context to the group.
- **Don't rely on color alone:** Avoid relying solely on color to convey
  information or the state of the select input. Ensure other visual cues convey
  the necessary information.
- **Ensure sufficient contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast exists
  between the select input's text, background, and border. Use a contrast
  checking tool to verify contrast ratios meet minimum requirements.
- **Keyboard navigation:** Make the select input fully operable using the
  keyboard. Allow users to navigate using Tab, open/close dropdown with Spacebar
  or Enter, navigate options with arrow keys, and select with Enter.
- **Focus visible:** Provide a clear and visible focus indicator for the select
  input when it receives keyboard focus.
- **No unexpected changes:** Prevent the select input from unexpectedly changing
  the context of the page when it receives focus. Ensure changes are initiated
  by user selection.
- **Clear instructions:** Provide clear and concise labels or instructions for
  the select input that accurately reflect its purpose.
- **Error suggestions:** If an input error is automatically detected and
  suggestions for correction are known, provide the suggestions to the user.
- **Use semantic HTML:** Use semantic HTML elements (`<select>`, `<option>`) to
  define the role, name, and value of the select input.
- **ARIA attributes:** Use ARIA attributes when necessary to provide additional
  information to assistive technologies, especially for complex or custom
  implementations.
