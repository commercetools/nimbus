## Guidelines

Design guidelines offer a set of standardized rules and recommendations that
ensure consistency, usability, and accessibility across all design elements and
interactions.

### Best practice

- **Include a label:** Give the users context on what is being asked for when
  making a selection. A picker without a label is ambiguous and not accessible.
  Use "Select" or "Search and select" as a default placeholder label wording.
  - In rare cases where context is sufficient to not need a label, these
    placements should still be given an aria-label in HTML.
  - **Placeholders:** Should function as a prompt not a value. Do not use a
    placeholder as a label.
- **Keep contents concise:** Long menu items that wrap to multiple lines should
  be kept to a minimum. If this becomes a frequent concern, consider an
  alternate UI component or pattern to allow for more breathing room for
  content.
- **Organize content:** The default organization is alphabetical, if a user
  benefits from better organization please improve their experience with better
  categories.
- **Include help text when needed:** If more information is needed to provide
  context, include helper text below the field for the user. Replace helper text
  with error text if applicable and needed.
- **Don't neglect ARIA attributes:** If you are building a custom select input,
  ensure that you use proper ARIA attributes to make the select box accessible
  to screen readers.

#### When to use a solid vs. ghost styled select input

| **Type**    | **Use this instead** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Solid-style** | <ul><li>The default option to use in forms.</li><li>Typically the best experience to use with content created by a user.</li><li>When you want to include search for the content.</li></ul>                |
| **Ghost-style** | <ul><li>The default option to use to filter or build rules around content. Ex: filtering assets for the user.</li><li>Best used within rule building experiences such as discounts.</li><li>Ideal to be used in condensed areas, with condensed and familiar options for the user, as in simple filters or quick actions like "delete".</li></ul> |

### Usage

Select inputs are common and users are familiar with their uses. Keeping
consistent with the guidelines will help our products intuitive and easy to
understand, even through complicated areas.

### Solid-styled widths

These placements are more regular, they have either a maximum width of 268px
or form wide. The popover width should match the width of the field itself.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - The form is at maximum size (when not in a pull page form) and the popover
>   matches the width of the field.
> - Longer options flow to the next lines, and when chosen, those longer texts
>   are truncated so the user can still see the icons clearly.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Do not have different widths for select inputs.
> - Do not change the width of the field to match the content once selected.

### Ghost-styled widths
There are a few differences that ghost-styled select inputs have that aren't
needed with solid-style placements. Ghost-styled fields should hug width, with
popovers having a min width matching the field, and max width being 268px unless
on a page wide form.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Select input field width set to "hug" with max width popover at 268px.
> - Content flows to next line when needed.

![](/images/select/ghost-styled-widths.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - This drop down icon looks like it is not related to the select input field.
> - Do not truncate options that should flow to the next line.

![](/images/select/ghost-styled-widths-dont.png)

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - With short selectable content, match content width to match the select
>   input "hug" width.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Do not set the popover width to "hug", this content should match the
>   width of the field.

### Labels and preselection

Make sure to place tooltips in areas where they will be seen easily.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Use a short and easily understandable label. Describe, do not use labels
>   as instructions.
> - Use placeholder if there isn't a most common or default choice.

![](/images/select/labels-and-preselection.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Do not rely on placeholders instead of labels.
> - Do not preselect a random option unless it's genuinely the most common
>   or default choice.

### Labels and layout exceptions

With the ghost styling for labels, there are some placements that can be used
without labels and have varying widths based on placement. These are most
commonly found in filters and with rule builders.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Use a short and easily understandable label.
> - Use placeholder if there isn't a most common or default choice.

![](/images/select/labels-and-layout-exceptions.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Try not to overuse drop downs. Do not make it unclear what parts of a
>   ghost-styled are interactive to the user.
> - Make sure that if logic is being used that it goes through user testing
>   and is understandable for the targeted user.

### Keep menu items concise

Keep menu items short and concise. Long menu items that cause text to wrap
multiple lines are discouraged. If text wrapping becomes a frequent concern,
consider revising the text or use alternative UI patterns that will give your
content more space.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Use a short and easily understandable label. Describe, do not use labels
>   as instructions.
> - Text can flow to three lines, but truncate further text.

![](/images/select/keep-menu-items-concise.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Keep content short or make sure that the location has enough room to
>   display content with more space.
> - Don't use additional labels or explainers when unneeded.
> - Do not encourage lengthy text for drop down experiences. Text can flow to
>   three lines, but truncate further text.

### Organize dropdown content when possible

Use grouping structures if all items in a list can be grouped for a better user
experience. By default, organize by alphabetical order.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Use labels within popover/drop downs to organize content.
> - Allow if possible for the user to search for items with type ahead fuzzy
>   search.
> - If actions lists become bulky and hard to scan, consider another experience
>   for the user.

![](/images/select/organize-dropdown-content-when-possible.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Don't bury frequently used actions within a dropdown or menu; instead,
>   prioritize them at the top and group related actions together to facilitate
>   quick user selection.

### Help and error text inclusion

Use helper text when needed, and replace helper text with error text if
triggered.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
> - Use helper text to give more context to the select input when needed.
>   Omit if self explanatory.
> - Error and helper text should be short and easily understood.

![](/images/select/help-and-error-text-inclusion.png)

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
> - Don't show both helper text and information text simultaneously.
