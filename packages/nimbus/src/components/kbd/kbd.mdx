# Keyboard key

The KBD component visually renders a keystroke or key combination to highlight it within textual instructions.

## Overview

The keyboard key component provides semantic and visual representation for keyboard input, such as a shortcut, key press, or command line input, ensuring clarity and consistency when providing user instructions.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features. 

### Basic
```jsx-live
const App = () => <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
```

### Key combinations
```jsx-live
const App = () => <div>Press <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd> to copy</div>
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <div>Press <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd> to copy</div>
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Semantic Meaning:** The `<kbd>` element provides clear semantic meaning to screen readers, indicating that the enclosed text represents keyboard input.
- **Reading Flow:** Ensure the KBD component doesn't interrupt the natural reading flow of the surrounding sentence.
- **Contrast:** The key's background color and the text color must adhere to WCAG contrast guidelines for legibility.
- **Focus (N/A):** Note that the KBD component itself is generally non-interactive and therefore should not be focusable via the keyboard.
