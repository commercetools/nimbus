# KBD

The KBD component visually renders a keystroke or key combination to highlight it within textual instructions.

### Overview

The keyboard key component provides semantic and visual representation for keyboard input, such as a shortcut, key press, or command line input, ensuring clarity and consistency when providing user instructions.

#### Resources

Deep dive into implementation details and access the Nimbus design library.

### Variables

Get familiar with the features. 

#### Basic
```jsx-live
const App = () => <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
```

#### Key combinations
```jsx-live
const App = () => <div>Press <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd> to copy</div>
```

## Guidelines

Visually displaying keyboard components helps users learn how to work more quickly and more efficiently. 

### Best Practices

- **Contextual usage:** Only use the KBD component when referencing a literal keyboard key press or shortcut. Do not use it for general UI elements (like buttons or links).
- **Maintain conciseness:** Keep the content inside the KBD component short—usually one or two words, or a symbol—to represent the specific key (e.g., Enter, Shift, Ctrl).
- **Combinations:** Clearly indicate key combinations using a simple, recognized separator (e.g., + or a hyphen) within the KBD component (e.g., Ctrl + S).
- **Visual consistency:** Ensure the KBD component's border, background color, and font style make it visually distinct from the surrounding text while remaining integrated with the overall design.
- **Appropriate sizing:** The size of the KBD text and box should be proportional to the surrounding body text to avoid unnecessary visual distraction.

### Usage

This component is an additional way to convey information in a non interactive way. Use in moderation, using too often can make text unreadable.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use
- Displaying keyboard shortcuts in help text or tooltips
- Representing individual keys in user interfaces
- Highlighting keyboard navigation instructions
- To display command line input or terminal code within technical instructions.
- To clearly show keyboard shortcuts in application documentation or tooltips (e.g., "Press Ctrl + Z to undo").

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use
- Don't allow the component to wrap excessively; keep the contained text short.
- Don't use KBD for displaying long code snippets (use a `<code>` block instead).
- Don't use KBD without accompanying explanatory text to provide context.

### Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <div>Press <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd> to copy</div>
```


### Accessibility Standards

- **Semantic Meaning:** The `<kbd>` element provides clear semantic meaning to screen readers, indicating that the enclosed text represents keyboard input.
- **Reading Flow:** Ensure the KBD component doesn't interrupt the natural reading flow of the surrounding sentence.
- **Contrast:** The key's background color and the text color must adhere to WCAG contrast guidelines for legibility.
- **Focus (N/A):** Note that the KBD component itself is generally non-interactive and therefore should not be focusable via the keyboard.
