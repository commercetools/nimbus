## Guidelines

Visually displaying keyboard components helps users learn how to work more
quickly and more efficiently.

### Best practices

- **Contextual usage:** Only use the KBD component when referencing a literal
  keyboard key press or shortcut. Do not use it for general UI elements (like
  buttons or links).
- **Maintain conciseness:** Keep the content inside the KBD component
  short—usually one or two words, or a symbol—to represent the specific key
  (e.g., Enter, Shift, Ctrl).
- **Combinations:** Clearly indicate key combinations using a simple, recognized
  separator (e.g., + or a hyphen) within the KBD component (e.g., Ctrl + S).
- **Visual consistency:** Ensure the KBD component's border, background color,
  and font style make it visually distinct from the surrounding text while
  remaining integrated with the overall design.
- **Appropriate sizing:** The size of the KBD text and box should be
  proportional to the surrounding body text to avoid unnecessary visual
  distraction.

### Usage

This component is an additional way to convey information in a non interactive
way. Use in moderation, using too often can make text unreadable.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- Displaying keyboard shortcuts in help text or tooltips
- Representing individual keys in user interfaces
- Highlighting keyboard navigation instructions
- To display command line input or terminal code within technical instructions.
- To clearly show keyboard shortcuts in application documentation or tooltips
  (e.g., "Press Ctrl + Z to undo").

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- Don't allow the component to wrap excessively; keep the contained text short.
- Don't use KBD for displaying long code snippets (use a `<code>` block
  instead).
- Don't use KBD without accompanying explanatory text to provide context.
