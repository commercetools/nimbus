Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <div>Press <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd> to copy</div>
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Semantic Meaning:** The `<kbd>` element provides clear semantic meaning to
  screen readers, indicating that the enclosed text represents keyboard input.
- **Reading Flow:** Ensure the KBD component doesn't interrupt the natural
  reading flow of the surrounding sentence.
- **Contrast:** The key's background color and the text color must adhere to
  WCAG contrast guidelines for legibility.
- **Focus (N/A):** Note that the KBD component itself is generally
  non-interactive and therefore should not be focusable via the keyboard.
