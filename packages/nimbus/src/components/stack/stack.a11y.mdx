## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="column" gap="400">
    <Button variant="solid">First</Button>
    <Button variant="outline">Second</Button>
    <Button variant="ghost">Third</Button>
  </Stack>
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Use semantic HTML:** Stack is a layout component that renders a `div` by
  default. Use the `as` prop to apply semantic elements when the stack has
  semantic meaning (e.g., `nav`, `section`).
- **Maintain reading order:** Ensure the visual stack order matches the DOM
  order so screen readers navigate content logically.
- **Avoid layout-only containers:** When possible, apply stack styles directly
  to semantic parent elements.
- **Focus order:** Ensure keyboard focus follows the logical stacking order (top
  to bottom for column, left to right for row).
- **Responsive design:** Ensure stacked layouts adapt appropriately for
  different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Don't rely on visual spacing alone:** Use semantic HTML to convey
  relationships between stacked items, not just visual separation.
