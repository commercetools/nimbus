## Guidelines

Pagination guidelines aim to support similar and consistent experiences for
users seeking to navigate their data or processes.

### Best practices

- **Provide clear feedback:** always highlight the current active page clearly.
- **Keep navigation minimal:** limit the visible page numbers shown to a
  manageable amount (e.g., show 5-7 pages).
- **Show total context:** display the total number of items or total pages
  available (e.g., "Showing 1-20 of 150 results").
- **Disable end controls:** clearly disable the "Previous" button on the first
  page and the "Next" button on the last page.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Control is essential:** When the user needs control over where they are and
  how many items they see.
- **Predictable data sets:** For data tables, structured search results, or
  catalogs where items have a known order and consistent size.
- **User needs to bookmark/reference:** When users need to easily save or share
  a specific page number, or refer back to a particular screen of results.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Unstructured or image-heavy content:** For image galleries or highly
  dynamic, unstructured content where infinite scrolling provides a smoother,
  faster visual experience.
- **Mobile experience:** Infinite scroll is often preferred on mobile devices to
  reduce the effort of tapping small pagination controls

### Pagination in use

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do allow direct input to jump to a specific page number (if the set is very
>   large).
> - Do place pagination controls consistently at the top, bottom, or both, of
>   the content being paginated.

```jsx live
const App = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
  const [pageSize, setPageSize] = useState(4);

  return (
    <Pagination
      totalItems={10240}
      currentPage={currentPage}
      pageSize={pageSize}
      pageSizeOptions={[4, 10, 20, 50]}
      enablePageSizeSelector
      enablePageInput
      onPageChange={setCurrentPage}
      onPageSizeChange={setPageSize}
    />
  );
};
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't reset the pagination every time a filter or sort option is applied;
>   try to maintain the user's current page if possible.
> - Don't overload the component with too many page numbers that visually
>   clutter the interface.
> - Don't hide or neglect to disable the 'Previous' or 'Next' buttons when they
>   are no longer functional.

```jsx live
const App = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1483271);
  const [pageSize, setPageSize] = useState(4);

  return (
    <Pagination
      totalItems={9007199254740991}
      currentPage={currentPage}
      pageSize={pageSize}
      pageSizeOptions={[4, 10, 20, 50]}
      enablePageSizeSelector
      enablePageInput
      onPageChange={setCurrentPage}
      onPageSizeChange={setPageSize}
    />
  );
};
```
