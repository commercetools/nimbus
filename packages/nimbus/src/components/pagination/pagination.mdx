# Pagination

Pagination is a component that divides a large set of content or data into sequential pages, providing navigation controls to move between them.

## Overview

Pagination contains controls for navigating with dedicated buttons for moving to the next and previous pages, visible page numbering for direct access, and clear feedback indicating the user's current page position within the total set of results.

### Visuals

**Page size selection paired with jump to page**

Use this combination for the most control over viewing and jumping to pages. This is best suited for navigating pagination with a lot of resources. Allowing users to jump to different pages as needed. 


```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = React.useState(1);
  const [pageSize, setPageSize] = React.useState(20);
  
  return (
    <Pagination
      totalItems={150}
      currentPage={currentPage}
      pageSize={pageSize}
      onPageChange={setCurrentPage}
      onPageSizeChange={setPageSize}
    />
  );
};
```
**Simplified paging without page input**

This combination allows users to select how many items appear on the page and tab through other existing pages. It simplifies paging but restricts users from jumping pages. This is better suited for content that is 20 pages or less. 

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = React.useState(1);
  const [pageSize, setPageSize] = React.useState(20);
  
  return (
    <Pagination
      totalItems={150}
      currentPage={currentPage}
      pageSize={pageSize}
      onPageChange={setCurrentPage}
      onPageSizeChange={setPageSize}
      enablePageInput={false}
    />
  );
};
```

**Without page size selector**

The simplest solution, and mainly for uses with minimal data or processes that have multiple steps. This won't allow users to select how much information is viewed on the page, but only to navigate through via tapping through the arrows.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = React.useState(1);
  
  return (
    <Box display="flex" justifyContent="flex-start">
      <Pagination
        totalItems={75}
        currentPage={currentPage}
        pageSize={15}
        onPageChange={setCurrentPage}
        enablePageInput={false}
        enablePageSizeSelector={false}
      />
    </Box>
  );
};
```

## Guidelines
Pagination guidelines aim to support similar and consistent experiences for users seeking to navigate their data or processes. 

### Best practices

 - **Provide clear feedback:** always highlight the current active page clearly.
 - **Keep navigation minimal:** limit the visible page numbers shown to a manageable amount (e.g., show 5-7 pages).
 - **Show total context:** display the total number of items or total pages available (e.g., "Showing 1-20 of 150 results").
 - **Disable end controls:** clearly disable the "Previous" button on the first page and the "Next" button on the last page.



### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Control is essential:** When the user needs control over where they are and how many items they see.
- **Predictable data sets:** For data tables, structured search results, or catalogs where items have a known order and consistent size.
- **User needs to bookmark/reference:** When users need to easily save or share a specific page number, or refer back to a particular screen of results.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Unstructured or image-heavy content:** For image galleries or highly dynamic, unstructured content where infinite scrolling provides a smoother, faster visual experience.
- **Mobile experience:** Infinite scroll is often preferred on mobile devices to reduce the effort of tapping small pagination controls




### Pagination in use

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do allow direct input to jump to a specific page number (if the set is very large).
> - Do place pagination controls consistently at the top, bottom, or both, of the content being paginated.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't reset the pagination every time a filter or sort option is applied; try to maintain the user's current page if possible.
> - Don't overload the component with too many page numbers that visually clutter the interface.
> - Don't hide or neglect to disable the 'Previous' or 'Next' buttons when they are no longer functional.

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical limitations.



```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = React.useState(1);
  const [pageSize, setPageSize] = React.useState(20);
  
  return (
    <Pagination
      totalItems={150}
      currentPage={currentPage}
      pageSize={pageSize}
      onPageChange={setCurrentPage}
      onPageSizeChange={setPageSize}
    />
  );
};
```

### Accessibility standards

- **ARIA Roles:** Use `role="navigation"` to identify the component as a navigation block. Use `aria-current="page"` on the active page link/button to signal the user's location to screen readers.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure the entire component is navigable using the Tab key and that all links/buttons are operable with the Enter key.
- **Descriptive Text:** Use `aria-label` on the navigation buttons ("Previous page," "Next page") to provide screen readers with unambiguous information, even if the visual text is just an arrow.
- **Focus Indication:** Provide a strong, clear focus indicator on the currently active navigation item when using keyboard control.
