## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = React.useState(1);
  const [pageSize, setPageSize] = React.useState(20);

  return (
    <Pagination
      totalItems={150}
      currentPage={currentPage}
      pageSize={pageSize}
      onPageChange={setCurrentPage}
      onPageSizeChange={setPageSize}
    />
  );
};
```

### Accessibility standards

- **ARIA Roles:** Use `role="navigation"` to identify the component as a
  navigation block. Use `aria-current="page"` on the active page link/button to
  signal the user's location to screen readers.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure the entire component is navigable using the
  Tab key and that all links/buttons are operable with the Enter key.
- **Descriptive Text:** Use `aria-label` on the navigation buttons ("Previous
  page," "Next page") to provide screen readers with unambiguous information,
  even if the visual text is just an arrow.
- **Focus Indication:** Provide a strong, clear focus indicator on the currently
  active navigation item when using keyboard control.
