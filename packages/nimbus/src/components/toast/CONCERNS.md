# Toast Implementation Concerns

| #   | Concern                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Status | Evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Extract constants (`DEFAULT_DURATION`, `VALID_PLACEMENTS`, `ALL_PLACEMENTS`, `DEFAULT_PLACEMENT`, `PLACEMENT_HOTKEYS`) from `toast.manager.ts` and `toast.toasters.ts` into a shared `constants/` folder | DONE   | YES — constants are duplicated across files (e.g. `VALID_PLACEMENTS` and `ALL_PLACEMENTS` are near-identical). The component guidelines explicitly list `constants/` as a standard subfolder.                                                                                                                 |
| 2   | Extract the inline `ChakraToastData` type from `toast.outlet.tsx` into `toast.types.ts`                                                                                                                  | DONE   | PARTIALLY — a `types/` subfolder is not the Nimbus pattern; the standard is a single `component-name.types.ts` file, which already exists. However, the inline `ChakraToastData` type in `toast.outlet.tsx` should be moved into `toast.types.ts`.                                                            |
| 3   | Remove all references to "Zag.js" from code comments and JSDoc across `toast.manager.ts`, `toast.outlet.tsx`, `toast.toasters.ts`, and `toast.stories.tsx` (5 occurrences)                               | DONE   | YES — 5 occurrences found in JSDoc/comments across 3 files. These reference an internal Chakra dependency and should not leak into our abstraction layer.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4   | Remove specific icon name references from the spec — describe custom icon support generically; all code examples (stories, tests, docs) can use Bathtub as the concrete example                          | DONE   | YES — the spec text should not mention a specific icon by name. Code examples in `toast.mdx`, `toast.dev.mdx`, stories, and tests all keep Bathtub as the demonstration icon.                                                                                                                                 |
| 5   | Simplify the `onPress` action callback documentation — document it as `action: { label: string; onPress: () => void }` without explaining the internal `onClick` mapping                                 | DONE   | YES — the current JSDoc in `toast.manager.ts` explains the internal `onPress` → `onClick` mapping which is an implementation detail consumers don't need to know about.                                                                                                                                       |
| 6   | Remove references to "original plan… Reduced from 6 by removing center placements…" from documentation                                                                                                   | DONE   | N/A — these phrases do not exist anywhere in the current codebase. Already cleaned up or never committed. This item can be closed.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 7   | Replace hard-coded `cubic-bezier` easing values in `toast.recipe.ts` with named easing tokens                                                                                                            | DONE   | YES — use `ease-out` for the enter transition (currently `cubic-bezier(0.21, 1.02, 0.73, 1)`) and `ease-in-smooth` for the exit transition (currently `cubic-bezier(0.06, 0.71, 0.55, 1)`). The enter curve loses its slight overshoot but aligns with the token system. Duration tokens are already correct. |
| 8   | Replace raw CSS variables (`var(--nimbus-colors-color-palette-5)`, etc.) in `toast.recipe.ts` with Chakra token syntax (`{colors.colorPalette.5}`)                                                       | DONE   | YES — 3 replacements needed. Multiple other recipes (data-table, money-input, progress-bar) already use `{colors.colorPalette.N}` inside `boxShadow` strings, confirming the pattern works.                                                                                                                   |
| 9   | Move `ToastContent` out of `toast.outlet.tsx` into a `components/` subfolder following the 1-component-per-file convention                                                                               | DONE   | YES — the `components/` subfolder with per-file organization is the established Nimbus pattern (used by Menu, Select, Accordion, etc.). `ToastContent` is currently an unexported component inlined in `toast.outlet.tsx`.                                                                                    |
