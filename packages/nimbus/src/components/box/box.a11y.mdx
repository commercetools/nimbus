## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Box as="section" p="100">
    Section content
  </Box>
);
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Use semantic HTML:** Box renders a `div` by default but can be changed to
  any other HTML element using the `as` prop. Choose appropriate semantic
  elements (e.g., `section`, `article`, `nav`) to provide meaningful structure.
- **Maintain proper document structure:** Ensure the chosen element maintains
  logical document hierarchy and semantic meaning.
- **Avoid layout-only divs when possible:** When the Box has semantic meaning,
  use the `as` prop to render the appropriate HTML element.
