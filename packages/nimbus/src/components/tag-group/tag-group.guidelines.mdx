## Guidelines

These guidelines provide comprehensive direction for designing and developing
tags within Nimbus.

### Best practices

- **Limit the number of tags:** Avoid overwhelming users with too many tags.
- **Maintain consistent styling:** Ensure tags look and behave uniformly across
  the product.
- **Provide clear affordance for removal:** If tags are removable, make the
  close icon visible and interactive.
- **Do not mix toggle-able and removable tags within the same area:** These are
  different types of selective interactions, avoid mixing to avoid confusion and
  clear use in your interface.
- **Single context:** Ensure all tags within a single group are relevant to one
  entity or topic (e.g., all tags describe a single product's features, or all
  tags represent filters applied to a list).
- **Conciseness:** Keep tag labels short and easily readable (ideally one or two
  words). If the text is too long, it should be truncated, and a tooltip should
  reveal the full context.
- **Logical ordering:** Arrange tags in a predictable, logical sequence, such as
  alphabetically, by date added, or by importance.
- **Color consistency:** Use color consistently to convey meaning. Define a
  clear palette for status tags (e.g., Green for "In Stock") and neutral colors
  for simple categorization.
- **Handling overflow:** Implement a clear strategy for managing too many tags
  (e.g., collapsing the list and showing a "+X more" count or allowing
  horizontal scrolling).

### Usage

Tags are used to display keywords. They also help filter data, allowing users to
narrow down lists of items, and show selected options, representing choices in
multi-select inputs.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Displaying metadata/attributes:** To showcase several non-hierarchical
  attributes of an item (e.g., product size, material, color, collection name).
- **Filtering statuses (interactive tags):** To show the user which filters are
  currently applied, often allowing them to click an 'x' to remove the filter
  immediately.
- **Categorization (non-interactive tags):** To quickly label and organize
  content pieces (e.g., "New," "Beta," "Requires Review").
- **Highlighting key status:** To draw attention to critical, secondary status
  information (e.g., "Out of Stock," "Draft").

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Primary navigation:** Do not use tags to replace main menu links or primary
  navigation structures.
- **Long sentences/descriptions:** If you need to convey complex sentences or
  lengthy descriptions, use standard body text or a detail panel instead.
- **Too many options:** If the list of possible tags is extremely long and
  variable (over 10-15 per group), consider using a multi-select dropdown with
  categorization instead.
- **Destructive actions:** Tags should not be used as the sole trigger for
  complex, destructive, or irreversible actions.
- **Mixing toggle-able and removable tags:** is not a good use of tooling, it
  creates a very confusing experience for users.

### Tags and tag group in use

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Do keep tag phrases short and descriptive.
> - Do keep removable tags easy to remove, and toggle-able tags easy to click.
>   Avoid moving them or shuffling them while a user is interacting with them.
>   Moving targets are harder to click.
> - Do keep styling and sizing consistent within the same context.
> - Do limit the amount of tags per context to not overwhelm the UI.

```jsx live
const App = () => {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState(
    new Set(["pop", "jazz", "hip-hop", "reggae"])
  );

  const musicGenres = [
    { id: "rock", name: "Rock" },
    { id: "pop", name: "Pop" },
    { id: "jazz", name: "Jazz" },
    { id: "hip-hop", name: "Hip Hop" },
    { id: "classical", name: "Classical" },
    { id: "reggae", name: "Reggae" },
    { id: "electronic", name: "Electronic" },
    { id: "country", name: "Country" },
  ];

  return (
    <Box width="9600">
      <TagGroup.Root
        aria-label="Music genres"
        selectionMode="multiple"
        selectedKeys={selected}
        onSelectionChange={setSelected}
      >
        <TagGroup.TagList items={musicGenres} gap="300">
          {(item) => <TagGroup.Tag>{item.name}</TagGroup.Tag>}
        </TagGroup.TagList>
      </TagGroup.Root>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don’t use long, multi-word phrases for tags.
> - Don't mix clearable or toggle status within tag groups. All should have the
>   same functions within the same context.
> - Don't overload the UI with an excessive number of tags.
> - Don't use colors that are a misuse of semantic meanings. Use the neutral
>   color options if colors are meant to show variety.
