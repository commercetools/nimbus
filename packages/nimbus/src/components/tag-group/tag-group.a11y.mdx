## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const vegetableOptions = [
  { id: "tomato", name: "Tomato" },
  { id: "zucchini", name: "Zucchini" },
  { id: "peppers", name: "Peppers" },
  ];

  return (
    <TagGroup.Root onRemove={() => {}}>
      <TagGroup.TagList items={vegetableOptions}>
        {(item) => <TagGroup.Tag>{item.name}</TagGroup.Tag>}
      </TagGroup.TagList>
    </TagGroup.Root>
  );
}
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Keyboard focus:** Ensure the user can navigate to and between individual
  tags (if interactive/removable) using the Tab key.
- **ARIA labels for removal:** For removable tags, the close button/icon must
  have a clear `aria-label` (e.g., "Remove filter: [Tag Label]") to inform
  screen readers exactly what is being dismissed.
- **Contrast:** Verify that the text contrast ratio against the tag's background
  color meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1).
- **Logical reading order:** The order in which the tags are read by a screen
  reader must logically align with the visual order.
