# Avatar

A small image or icon that identifies and personalizes the user within the
interface.

last name.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Size

**Medium** (40px)

Most commonly used in the upper right hand side of the page paired with a
drop-down menu.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Avatar firstName="Adam" lastName="Vadam" src="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ " size="md" />
    <Avatar firstName="Adam" lastName="Vadam" size="md" /> {/* Shows initials when no image */}
  </Stack>
)
```

**X-Small** (32px)

Use small circle avatars in tighter areas like text fields and dropdown fields
or when it is less important information.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Avatar firstName="Adam" lastName="Vadam" src="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ " size="xs" />
    <Avatar firstName="Adam" lastName="Vadam" size="xs" /> {/* Shows initials when no image */}
  </Stack>
)
```

**2x-Small** (24px)

Use these in condensed areas like notifications or filters.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Avatar firstName="Adam" lastName="Vadam" src="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ " size="2xs" />
    <Avatar firstName="Adam" lastName="Vadam" size="2xs" /> {/* Shows initials when no image */}
  </Stack>
)
```

### Initials and images

#### Avatar initials

The default and fallback for avatar graphics is to use initials. Default color
should use Primary, but is open to custom colors.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Avatar firstName="Adam" lastName="Vadam" />
)
```

## Specs

<PropsTable id="Avatar" />

## Accessibility

The Avatar component is a thumbnail representation of an entity, such as a user
or an organization. They accept a `src` attribute defining the image URL, and an
`alt` attribute for an accessible description.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Avatar firstName="Adam" lastName="Vadam" src="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ " />
)
```

### Accessibility Standards

#### 1. Perceivable:

- **1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A):** This is the most crucial guideline for
  avatars. Since avatars are visual, they must have a text alternative. This is
  typically implemented using the alt attribute on the `<img>` tag (if the
  avatar is an image) or through `ARIA` if the avatar is more complex. The alt
  text should describe the avatar's purpose or what it represents (e.g., "User
  profile picture," "John Doe's avatar," "Company logo"). If the avatar is
  purely decorative and doesn't convey any meaningful information, the alt
  attribute should be empty (`alt=""`).
- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A):** If the avatar is associated with
  other information (e.g., a username, profile link), the relationship should be
  programmatically determinable. This can be achieved using semantic `HTML`
  (e.g., placing the avatar and username within a single element) or ARIA
  attributes (e.g., `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`).
- **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A):** Don't rely on color alone to convey
  information about the avatar (e.g., using a colored border to indicate
  status). Any information conveyed by color must also be available through
  other means.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA):** If the avatar contains any text
  (which is less common), that text must meet minimum contrast ratio
  requirements.

#### 2. Operable:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A):** If the avatar is interactive (e.g., clicking it
  opens a profile), it must be operable using the keyboard. This means the user
  should be able to navigate to the avatar using the Tab key and activate it
  using the Enter or Space key.
- **2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A):** If the avatar is a link, its
  purpose should be clear from the surrounding context or from the avatar's alt
  text. Avoid generic link text like "Click here."
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA):** If the avatar is interactive, it should
  have a visible focus indicator when it receives keyboard focus.

#### 3. Understandable:

- **3.2.1 On Focus (Level A):** If the avatar is interactive and its appearance
  changes on focus, the change should not be disorienting or unexpected.

#### 4. Robust:

- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A):** Assistive technologies should be able
  to correctly interpret the role of the avatar (e.g., `image`, `link`) and its
  name (from the alt text).
