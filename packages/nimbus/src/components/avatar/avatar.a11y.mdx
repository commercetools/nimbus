## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Avatar firstName="Adam" lastName="Vadam" src="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ " />
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Non-text content:** Avatars must have a text alternative. Use the `alt`
  attribute on the `<img>` tag (if the avatar is an image) or through `ARIA` if
  the avatar is more complex. The alt text should describe the avatar's purpose
  or what it represents (e.g., "User profile picture," "John Doe's avatar,"
  "Company logo"). If the avatar is purely decorative and doesn't convey any
  meaningful information, the alt attribute should be empty (`alt=""`).
- **Info and relationships:** If the avatar is associated with other information
  (e.g., a username, profile link), the relationship should be programmatically
  determinable. This can be achieved using semantic `HTML` (e.g., placing the
  avatar and username within a single element) or ARIA attributes (e.g.,
  `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`).
- **Use of color:** Don't rely on color alone to convey information about the
  avatar (e.g., using a colored border to indicate status). Any information
  conveyed by color must also be available through other means.
- **Color contrast:** If the avatar contains any text (which is less common),
  that text must meet minimum contrast ratio requirements.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** If the avatar is interactive (e.g., clicking it
  opens a profile), it must be operable using the keyboard. Users should be able
  to navigate to the avatar using the Tab key and activate it using the Enter or
  Space key.
- **Link purpose:** If the avatar is a link, its purpose should be clear from
  the surrounding context or from the avatar's alt text. Avoid generic link text
  like "Click here."
- **Focus visible:** If the avatar is interactive, it should have a visible
  focus indicator when it receives keyboard focus.
- **On focus:** If the avatar is interactive and its appearance changes on
  focus, the change should not be disorienting or unexpected.
- **Name, role, value:** Assistive technologies should be able to correctly
  interpret the role of the avatar (e.g., `image`, `link`) and its name (from
  the alt text).
