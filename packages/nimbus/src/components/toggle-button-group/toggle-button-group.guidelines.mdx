## Guidelines

Button group guidelines focus on presenting sets of related actions in a clear, organized, and accessible manner, enabling users to easily understand and choose between the available options, often emphasizing visual connection and logical arrangement.

### Best practices

-   **Order logically:** Arrange buttons by importance or user flow.
-   **Use clear labels:** Keep button text concise and understandable, if using icons, utilize tooltip labels.
-   **Limit button count:** Avoid overwhelming users with too many options.
-   **Space appropriately:** Place button groups close to controlled content.
-   **Ensure accessibility:** Make them navigable and understandable by everyone.

### Usage

A button group is best used when you need to present users with a set of closely related, mutually exclusive (e.g., a user selecting data table views), or complementary actions that are important enough to be displayed directly in the interface for quick access. Think of scenarios where users need to make a choice between a few options or perform a series of connected tasks within a specific context.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use
-   **Grouping related actions:** Organize similar tasks together. Use button groups to cluster actions that are logically connected, like order processing steps or product editing options.
-   **Providing mutually exclusive choices:** Offer clear alternatives. When users need to select only one option from a set, like filtering by order status or choosing a report timeframe.
-   **Streamlining workflows:** Enable quick task completion. For frequently performed actions on a single item or within a specific context, like managing inventory or editing customer details.
-   **Conserving screen space:** Present options compactly. When screen real estate is limited, button groups offer a space-efficient way to display multiple relevant actions.
-   **Enhancing visual clarity:** Improve comprehension of options. Visually connecting related buttons helps users understand the available choices and their relationships.
-   **Facilitating efficient navigation:** Offer quick jumps within a section. For navigating between closely related views or steps within a specific management area.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use
-   **Do not use a button group as a tab navigation:** There is a specific [tab component](#), please use this component instead. There is better accessibility support, and consistency with other designs and uses.
-   **Unrelated actions:** Don't group unrelated actions together. If buttons perform completely different tasks, a button group can be confusing.
-   **Overcrowding the UI:** Avoid too many buttons within a group. Too much choice confuses users and makes decision making more difficult.
-   **Do not use for multi-stepped processes:** Button groups are for single click actions, not for guiding users through complex sequences.
-   **Avoid if actions aren't logically linked:** If there is no clear relationship between the buttons, grouping them may be misleading.

### Selecting views

To allow users to switch between different display views (e.g., grid view, list view, map view). Make sure that users can easily recognize icons and pair with hover tooltips.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> -   Do use clear differentiated, and familiar icons for users to be able to toggle options.
> -   Do use tooltips to easily explain what a tool is to a user.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButtonGroup.Root aria-label="Select view" selectedKeys={["view-list"]} colorPalette="primary">
    <Tooltip.Root delay={0} closeDelay={0}>
      <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="view-grid" aria-label="Grid View">
        <Icons.Apps />
      </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
      <Tooltip.Content>Grid View</Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Root delay={0} closeDelay={0}>
      <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="view-list" aria-label="List View">
        <Icons.List />
      </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
      <Tooltip.Content>List View</Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Root>
    <Tooltip.Root delay={0} closeDelay={0}>
      <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="view-map" aria-label="Map View">
        <Icons.ViewWeek />
      </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
      <Tooltip.Content>Week View</Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Root>
  </ToggleButtonGroup.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> -   Do not use icons that users will not easily recognize or pairings of icons that seem too visually similar.
> -   Always pair icon buttons with tooltip labels for all users.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButtonGroup.Root aria-label="Select view (Bad Example)" selectedKeys={["view-confusing2"]} colorPalette="primary">
    <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="view-confusing1" aria-label="Confusing Icon 1">
      <Icons.Apartment />
    </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
    <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="view-confusing2" aria-label="Confusing Icon 2">
      <Icons.ProductionQuantityLimits />
    </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
    <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="view-confusing3" aria-label="Confusing Icon 3">
      <Icons.Tour />
    </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
  </ToggleButtonGroup.Root>
);
```

### Filter information

In data tables or lists, button groups can be used to filter or sort content.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> -   When using button groups to show filtered lists, pair closely with information to make sure that users know that this interaction shows tagged information instead of changing the state of any selected data. This can sometimes look like an item count included with the button group items.
> -   It is not good practice to mix styles in button groupings.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButtonGroup.Root aria-label="Filter status" selectedKeys={["filter-accepted"]} colorPalette="primary">
    <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="filter-drafts">
      Drafts (6)
    </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
    <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="filter-accepted">
      Accepted (2)
    </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
    <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="filter-rejected">
      Rejected (10)
    </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
  </ToggleButtonGroup.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> -   Do not confuse the user with unclear options.
> -   Do not use unfamiliar and lengthly labels.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <ToggleButtonGroup.Root aria-label="Filter status (Bad Example)" selectedKeys={["filter-granted"]} colorPalette="primary">
    <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="filter-compositions">
      Compositions
    </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
    <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="filter-granted">
      Granted
    </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
    <ToggleButtonGroup.Button id="filter-veto">
      Veto
    </ToggleButtonGroup.Button>
  </ToggleButtonGroup.Root>
);
```
