## Accessibility

The Dialog component follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines and implements proper modal
dialog patterns.

### Keyboard Navigation

| Key           | Action                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Tab`         | Move focus to next focusable element within dialog     |
| `Shift + Tab` | Move focus to previous focusable element within dialog |
| `Escape`      | Close the dialog (unless disabled)                     |
| `Enter/Space` | Activate focused button or trigger                     |

### Screen Reader Support

- **Role identification**: Dialog has `dialog` role with proper labeling
- **Focus management**: Focus moves to dialog on open, returns to trigger on
  close
- **Focus containment**: Tab navigation stays within dialog boundaries
- **Accessible names**: Title and description properly associate with dialog
- **State announcements**: Screen readers announce when dialog opens/closes

### WCAG Compliance

#### 1. Perceivable

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships**: Proper semantic structure with header, body,
  footer
- **1.4.3 Contrast**: All text meets minimum contrast requirements
- **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast**: Focus indicators and UI components meet contrast
  standards

#### 2. Operable

- **2.1.1 Keyboard**: Full keyboard navigation support
- **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap**: Focus contained but escapable via Escape key
- **2.4.3 Focus Order**: Logical focus progression through dialog elements
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible**: Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements

#### 3. Understandable

- **3.2.1 On Focus**: No unexpected context changes when focusing elements
- **3.2.2 On Input**: Predictable behavior for all user interactions
- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions**: Clear labeling and instructions where needed

#### 4. Robust

- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: Proper semantic markup and ARIA attributes
- **4.1.3 Status Messages**: Appropriate announcements for state changes

The Dialog component ensures that all users, regardless of their abilities or
assistive technologies, can effectively interact with dialog content.
