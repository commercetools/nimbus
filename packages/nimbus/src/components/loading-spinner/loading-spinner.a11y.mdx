## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <LoadingSpinner aria-label="Loading data" />;
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Use an accessible label to provide context:** Always provide an `aria-label`
  to describe what is loading.
- **Hide the spinner from assistive technologies when it's not visible or in
  use:** Use appropriate ARIA attributes to manage visibility.
- **Announce a change in state to screen readers:** Update users on the loading
  progress using live regions.
- **Ensure the contrast ratio is at least 3:1 against the background:** Verify
  color contrast meets accessibility standards.
- **Use aria-label to describe the spinner:** Provide clear, concise
  descriptions like "Loading data" or "Processing request".
- **Do not rely on color alone to communicate information:** Use additional
  visual cues beyond color.
- **Provide a clear indication of what is loading or the action being
  performed:** Be specific in your aria-label.
- **Ensure the spinner has a valid HTML structure and role:** The component uses
  `role="progressbar"` by default.
