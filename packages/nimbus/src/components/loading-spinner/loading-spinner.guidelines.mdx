## Guidelines

Loading spinner guidelines aim to provide clear and consistent visual feedback
to users during processing delays, ensuring they understand the system is active
and preventing frustration by indicating that they need to wait.

### Best practices

- **Appropriate placement:** Position the spinner close to the element or area
  that's loading. For full-page loads, center the spinner on the screen. For
  inline loading, place the spinner in the location of the content that will be
  loading.
- **Provide context:** If the loading time is expected to be lengthy, consider
  adding a brief message like "Loading..." or "Please wait..." alongside the
  spinner. For very long loading periods, consider adding a percentage bar, or
  estimated time to let the user come back when ready.
- **Responsive and smooth animation:** Ensure the spinner's animation is smooth
  and doesn't lag or stutter.
- **Accessibility:** Use ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-busy, aria-label) to
  provide context for screen readers. If the loading time is excessive, provide
  a way to cancel the loading process.
- **Avoid overuse:** Use spinners only when necessary, such as during data
  fetching or processing.
- **Fallback options:** Have a fallback plan in case the loading action fails.
  Display an error message, and provide a way for the user to retry.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Data is being fetched:** When your application is retrieving data from a
  server or database, especially if it might take a noticeable amount of time.
- **Processes are running:** During background operations, file uploads, or
  complex calculations that cause a delay.
- **Content is loading:** When new content is being loaded dynamically, such as
  images, videos, or web pages.
- **Actions are being processed:** After a user initiates an action, such as
  submitting a form or saving data, and the system requires time to complete the
  task.
- **Any time a user action causes a delay:** When a user interacts with the UI
  and there is a delay that could cause confusion or a perception of the UI
  being broken.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **For extremely quick actions:** If an action completes in less than a few
  hundred milliseconds, a spinner is unnecessary and can feel jarring or
  distracting.
- **For simple UI interactions:** Actions like toggling a switch, expanding a
  menu, or simple animations shouldn't trigger a spinner.
- **When the wait is unpredictable or excessively long:** If you can't provide
  any indication of how long the wait will be, or if it might be excessively
  long, consider alternative indicators with a cancel option or other help text.
- **When it creates unnecessary visual clutter:** Overusing spinners can make
  the UI feel busy and distracting.
- **When a more subtle visual cue is sufficient:** For very short delays, a
  change in cursor, a slight fade, or a brief message might be more appropriate.

### Loading spinner within elements

When showing the process of content loading you may add the loading spinner
within elements.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use loading spinner in a disabled state so a user cannot interact with the
>   button fully till the action is complete.
> - If the time expected to complete is short, no language is needed.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Flex gap="200">
    <Button colorPalette="primary" variant="solid" isDisabled>
      <LoadingSpinner colorPalette="white" />
      Saving...
    </Button>
    <Button colorPalette="primary" variant="solid" isDisabled>
      <LoadingSpinner colorPalette="white" />
    </Button>
  </Flex>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not keep the button clickable while using a loading state.
> - Do not use creative or funny phrases if using loading spinner in small
>   areas, to avoid confusing the user.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Flex gap="200">
    <Button colorPalette="primary" variant="solid">
      <LoadingSpinner colorPalette="white" />
      Remembering details...
    </Button>
  </Flex>
);
```

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use the loading spinner to show that content will be populated in that area.
> - Keep loading messages short and clear.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="200" alignItems="start">
    <Button variant="ghost" size="sm" colorPalette="primary">
      <Icons.Add />
      Add filter
    </Button>
    <Card.Root elevation="elevated">
      <Card.Content>
        <Stack gap="200">
          <ComboBox.Root
            inputValue="abc"
            aria-label="Search filters"
            allowsEmptyMenu
          >
            <ComboBox.Trigger />
          </ComboBox.Root>
          <Stack direction="horizontal" alignSelf="center" gap="200">
            <LoadingSpinner colorPalette="primary" />
            <Text>Loading results...</Text>
          </Stack>
        </Stack>
      </Card.Content>
    </Card.Root>
  </Stack>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't use long statements. Try to keep updates and explainers short, as
>   translation will consistently add about 20% more length.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="200" alignItems="start">
    <Button variant="ghost" size="sm" colorPalette="primary">
      <Icons.Add />
      Add filter
    </Button>
    <Card.Root elevation="elevated">
      <Card.Content>
        <Stack gap="200">
          <ComboBox.Root
            inputValue="abc"
            aria-label="Search filters"
            allowsEmptyMenu
          >
            <ComboBox.Trigger />
          </ComboBox.Root>
          <Stack
            direction="horizontal"
            gap="200"
            alignSelf="center"
            width="2/3"
          >
            <LoadingSpinner colorPalette="primary" flexShrink="0" />
            <Text>this is taking an unusually long time</Text>
          </Stack>
        </Stack>
      </Card.Content>
    </Card.Root>
  </Stack>
);
