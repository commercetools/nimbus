# LoadingSpinner

A circular visual indicator that displays the loading status of an ongoing
process. It can represent either determinate or indeterminate progress.

## Overview

A loading spinner's primary usage is to visually communicate to the user that a
process is ongoing and that they need to wait. It indicates that the system is
working and prevents the user from thinking the application is frozen or
unresponsive.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visuals

#### On white background

Most common, this is the default spinner animation to be used on white
backgrounds.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <LoadingSpinner aria-label="Loading content" />
```

#### On dark background

This is the default spinner animation to be used on dark backgrounds.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Stack backgroundColor="neutral.8"><LoadingSpinner aria-label="Loading content" colorPalette="white" /></Stack>
```

### Size

Loading spinners have five sizes to choose from: large, medium, small, x-small,
and 2x-small.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="400">
    <LoadingSpinner size="lg" aria-label="Large spinner" />
    <LoadingSpinner size="md" aria-label="Medium spinner" />
    <LoadingSpinner size="sm" aria-label="Small spinner" />
    <LoadingSpinner size="xs" aria-label="Extra small spinner" />
    <LoadingSpinner size="2xs" aria-label="Extra extra small spinner" />
  </Stack>
)
```

## Guidelines

Loading spinner guidelines aim to provide clear and consistent visual feedback
to users during processing delays, ensuring they understand the system is active
and preventing frustration by indicating that they need to wait.

### Best practices

- **Appropriate placement:** Position the spinner close to the element or area
  that's loading. For full-page loads, center the spinner on the screen. For
  inline loading, place the spinner in the location of the content that will be
  loading.
- **Provide context:** If the loading time is expected to be lengthy, consider
  adding a brief message like "Loading..." or "Please wait..." alongside the
  spinner. For very long loading periods, consider adding a percentage bar, or
  estimated time to let the user come back when ready.
- **Responsive and smooth animation:** Ensure the spinner's animation is smooth
  and doesn't lag or stutter.
- **Accessibility:** Use ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-busy, aria-label) to
  provide context for screen readers. If the loading time is excessive, provide
  a way to cancel the loading process.
- **Avoid overuse:** Use spinners only when necessary, such as during data
  fetching or processing.
- **Fallback options:** Have a fallback plan in case the loading action fails.
  Display an error message, and provide a way for the user to retry.

### Usage

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Data is being fetched:** When your application is retrieving data from a
  server or database, especially if it might take a noticeable amount of time.
- **Processes are running:** During background operations, file uploads, or
  complex calculations that cause a delay.
- **Content is loading:** When new content is being loaded dynamically, such as
  images, videos, or web pages.
- **Actions are being processed:** After a user initiates an action, such as
  submitting a form or saving data, and the system requires time to complete the
  task.
- **Any time a user action causes a delay:** When a user interacts with the UI
  and there is a delay that could cause confusion or a perception of the UI
  being broken.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **For extremely quick actions:** If an action completes in less than a few
  hundred milliseconds, a spinner is unnecessary and can feel jarring or
  distracting.
- **For simple UI interactions:** Actions like toggling a switch, expanding a
  menu, or simple animations shouldn't trigger a spinner.
- **When the wait is unpredictable or excessively long:** If you can't provide
  any indication of how long the wait will be, or if it might be excessively
  long, consider alternative indicators with a cancel option or other help text.
- **When it creates unnecessary visual clutter:** Overusing spinners can make
  the UI feel busy and distracting.
- **When a more subtle visual cue is sufficient:** For very short delays, a
  change in cursor, a slight fade, or a brief message might be more appropriate.

### Loading spinner within elements

When showing the process of content loading you may add the loading spinner
within elements.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use loading spinner in a disabled state so a user cannot interact with the
>   button fully till the action is complete.
> - If the time expected to complete is short, no language is needed.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Flex gap="200">
  <Button colorPalette="primary" variant="solid" isDisabled>
    <LoadingSpinner colorPalette="white" /> 
    Saving...
  </Button> 
  <Button colorPalette="primary" variant="solid" isDisabled>
    <LoadingSpinner colorPalette="white" />
  </Button>
</Flex>
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not keep the button clickable while using a loading state.
> - Do not use creative or funny phrases if using loading spinner in small
>   areas, to avoid confusing the user.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Flex gap="200">
  <Button colorPalette="primary" variant="solid">
    <LoadingSpinner colorPalette="white" /> 
    Remembering details...
  </Button>
)
```

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use the loading spinner to show that content will be populated in that area.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Don't use long statements. Try to keep updates and explainers short, as
>   translation will consistently add about 20% more length.

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

### Accessibility standards

- **Use an accessible label to provide context:** Always provide an `aria-label`
  to describe what is loading.
- **Hide the spinner from assistive technologies when it's not visible or in
  use:** Use appropriate ARIA attributes to manage visibility.
- **Announce a change in state to screen readers:** Update users on the loading
  progress using live regions.
- **Ensure the contrast ratio is at least 3:1 against the background:** Verify
  color contrast meets accessibility standards.
- **Use aria-label to describe the spinner:** Provide clear, concise
  descriptions like "Loading data" or "Processing request".
- **Do not rely on color alone to communicate information:** Use additional
  visual cues beyond color.
- **Provide a clear indication of what is loading or the action being
  performed:** Be specific in your aria-label.
- **Ensure the spinner has a valid HTML structure and role:** The component uses
  `role="progressbar"` by default.
