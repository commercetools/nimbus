## Overview

A loading spinner's primary usage is to visually communicate to the user that a
process is ongoing and that they need to wait. It indicates that the system is
working and prevents the user from thinking the application is frozen or
unresponsive.

### Visuals

#### On white background

backgrounds.

```jsx live
const App = () => <LoadingSpinner aria-label="Loading content" />
```

#### On dark background

This is the default spinner animation to be used on dark backgrounds.

### Size

Loading spinners have five sizes to choose from: large, medium, small, x-small,
