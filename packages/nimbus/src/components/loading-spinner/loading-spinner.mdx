# LoadingSpinner

A circular visual indicator that displays the loading status of an ongoing
process. It can represent either determinate or indeterminate progress.

## Overview

A loading spinner's primary usage is to visually communicate to the user that a
process is ongoing and that they need to wait. It indicates that the system is
working and prevents the user from thinking the application is frozen or
unresponsive.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Visuals

#### On white background

Most common, this is the default spinner animation to be used on white
backgrounds.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <LoadingSpinner aria-label="Loading content" />
```

#### On dark background

This is the default spinner animation to be used on dark backgrounds.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <Stack backgroundColor="neutral.8"><LoadingSpinner aria-label="Loading content" colorPalette="white" /></Stack>
```

### Size

Loading spinners have five sizes to choose from: large, medium, small, x-small,
and 2x-small.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="row" gap="400">
    <LoadingSpinner size="lg" aria-label="Large spinner" />
    <LoadingSpinner size="md" aria-label="Medium spinner" />
    <LoadingSpinner size="sm" aria-label="Small spinner" />
    <LoadingSpinner size="xs" aria-label="Extra small spinner" />
    <LoadingSpinner size="2xs" aria-label="Extra extra small spinner" />
  </Stack>
)
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

### Accessibility standards

- **Use an accessible label to provide context:** Always provide an `aria-label`
  to describe what is loading.
- **Hide the spinner from assistive technologies when it's not visible or in
  use:** Use appropriate ARIA attributes to manage visibility.
- **Announce a change in state to screen readers:** Update users on the loading
  progress using live regions.
- **Ensure the contrast ratio is at least 3:1 against the background:** Verify
  color contrast meets accessibility standards.
- **Use aria-label to describe the spinner:** Provide clear, concise
  descriptions like "Loading data" or "Processing request".
- **Do not rely on color alone to communicate information:** Use additional
  visual cues beyond color.
- **Provide a clear indication of what is loading or the action being
  performed:** Be specific in your aria-label.
- **Ensure the spinner has a valid HTML structure and role:** The component uses
  `role="progressbar"` by default.
