## Accessibility

Tooltip triggers must be focusable and hoverable in order to ensure that all
users can activate them. When displayed, the Tooltip automatically associates
the tooltip with the trigger element so that it is described by the tooltip
content.

Authors should ensure that elements with the
[role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles)
tooltip are referenced through the use of
[aria-describedby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby)
before or at the time the tooltip is displayed.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center" marginLeft="800" padding="800" gap="400">
    <Tooltip.Root>
      <Button>Hover me</Button>
      <Tooltip.Content>This is a tooltip</Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Root>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Non-text content:** Provide a text alternative (alt text or equivalent) for
  non-text content within tooltips.
- **Info and relationships:** Programmatically establish the relationship
  between a tooltip and its trigger element using ARIA attributes like
  `aria-describedby`. Assign an id to the trigger element and point
  `aria-describedby` to that id.
- **Use of color:** Avoid relying solely on color to convey information within
  tooltips.
- **Color contrast:** Ensure tooltip text meets minimum contrast ratio
  requirements. Use a contrast checking tool.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** Make tooltips triggered by keyboard focus operable
  via keyboard. Allow users to navigate to the trigger using the Tab key. Make
  the tooltip appear on focus. Prevent tooltips from trapping keyboard focus.
  Make interactive tooltip content keyboard accessible.
- **Focus visible:** Provide a visible focus indicator for the tooltip trigger
  element when it receives keyboard focus.
- **Language of page:** Programmatically determine the tooltip content's
  language. Use the `lang` attribute on the tooltip element.
- **On focus:** Prevent tooltips that appear on focus from unexpectedly changing
  the page context.
- **Labels or instructions:** Write tooltip text that is clear, concise, and
  easy to understand.
- **Name, role, value:** Ensure assistive technologies correctly interpret the
  role of the tooltip trigger element. Use semantic HTML. Use `aria-describedby`
  to associate the tooltip with the trigger.
