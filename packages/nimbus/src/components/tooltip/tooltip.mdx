# Tooltips

---

Tooltips display informative text when users hover over or focus on an element.

## Overview

Tooltips offer concise, non-obtrusive guidance and supplemental information, enhancing user understanding and interaction with UI elements.

### Resources

## Variables

Get familiar with the features. 

### Placements

Tooltip placements can populate in different areas, please chose a direction that will be most visible for the users. and the elements that may be interacting around them. Options include bottom left, bottom center, bottom right, top left, top center, top right, left top, left center, left bottom, right top, right center, right bottom. 

## Guidelines
Use tooltips to provide brief explanations, definitions, or instructions for interactive elements, enhancing the user experience.


### Best practices

- **Be concise:** Keep tooltip text short and to the point. Avoid lengthy explanations; if more detail is needed, consider a different approach like a modal or help documentation.
- **Provide valuable context:** Tooltips should offer information that isn't immediately obvious from the UI element itself. They should add value, not just restate what's already visible.
- **Use clear and simple language:** Avoid jargon, technical terms, or overly complex phrasing.  Tooltips should be easily understood by all users.
- **Position tooltips appropriately:** Place tooltips so they don't obscure the element they're related to or other important UI elements. Consider the user's mouse path and avoid accidental triggers.
- **Maintain accessibility:** Includes keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. Use ARIA attributes like `aria-describedby`to link the tooltip to its target element.
- **Avoid overuse:** Don't use tooltips for every single UI element. Overuse can make the interface feel cluttered.
- **Don't rely on tooltips for essential information:**  Crucial information (like error states) should never be exclusively conveyed through tooltips, as they are not always discoverable or accessible to all users. Use tooltips for supplementary or secondary details.


## Usage

Tooltips are a valuable tool for providing concise, contextual information, but they should be used strategically and not as a replacement for clear and accessible design. Think carefully about the type of information you're presenting and choose the most appropriate UI element for the job.


### Using tooltips for icons buttons

Icons often rely on shared universal understanding. A tooltip provides a text label that removes any ambiguity and ensures users understand the button's function. This is especially important for less common or custom icons.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Describe the icon’s action quickly and concisely.  

```jsx-live
const App = () =>  (
    <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center" gap="100" >
      <Badge backgroundColor="black" size="xs" color="white">Edit name</Badge>
       <IconButton tone="primary" variant="ghost" size="md">
        <Icons.Edit/>
       </IconButton>
    </Stack>
  )

```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not describe the icon visually.
> - Do not over explain the action to the user.
> - Don’t overlap tooltips with the object it is clarifying.

```jsx-live

const App = () =>  (
    <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center" position="relative" >
      <Badge 
        backgroundColor="black" 
        size="xs" 
        color="white" 
        css={{ 
          maxWidth: '275px',
          whiteSpace: 'normal',
          py: '20px',
        }}
      >
        Pencil icon that will let you edit your profile name if you like.
      </Badge>
      <IconButton 
        tone="primary" 
        variant="ghost" 
        size="md" 
        css={{ 
          position: 'absolute', 
          left: '255px'
        }}
      >
        <Icons.Edit/>
      </IconButton>
    </Stack>
  )
```

### Accessibility

Tooltip triggers must be focusable and hoverable in order to ensure that all users can activate them. When displayed, TooltipTrigger automatically associates the tooltip with the trigger element so that it is described by the tooltip content.

Authors SHOULD ensure that elements with the [role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) tooltip are referenced through the use of [aria-describedby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby) before or at the time the tooltip is displayed.

### Accessibility Standards
#### 1. Perceivable:
- **1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A):**
Provide a text alternative (alt text or equivalent) for non-text content within tooltips.
- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A):**
Programmatically establish the relationship between a tooltip and its trigger element using ARIA attributes like `aria-describedby`. Assign an id to the trigger element and point `aria-describedby` to that id.
- **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A):**
Avoid relying solely on color to convey information within tooltips.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA):**
Ensure tooltip text meets minimum contrast ratio requirements. Use a contrast checking tool.

#### 2. Operable:
- **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A):**
Make tooltips triggered by keyboard focus operable via keyboard. Allow users to navigate to the trigger using the Tab key. Make the tooltip appear on focus. Prevent tooltips from trapping keyboard focus. Make interactive tooltip content keyboard accessible.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA):**
Provide a visible focus indicator for the tooltip trigger element when it receives keyboard focus.

#### 3.Understandable:
- **3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A):**
Programmatically determine the tooltip content's language. Use the `lang` attribute on the tooltip element.
- **3.2.1 On Focus (Level A):**
Prevent tooltips that appear on focus from unexpectedly changing the page context.
- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A):**
Write tooltip text that is clear, concise, and easy to understand.

#### 4. Robust:
- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A):**
Ensure assistive technologies correctly interpret the role of the tooltip trigger element. Use semantic HTML. Use `aria-describedby` to associate the tooltip with the trigger.
