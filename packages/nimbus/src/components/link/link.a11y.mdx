## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () =>  (
  <Link href="#" size="md" fontColor="primary">
    Click me... with your keyboard
  </Link>
 );
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Non-text content:** Provide text alternatives for any non-text content
  within or associated with links (e.g., icons embedded in links). Use alt text
  for images within links and provide text equivalents for other non-text
  content.
- **Use of color:** Avoid relying solely on color to distinguish links from
  surrounding text. Provide additional visual cues, such as underlines, bold
  text, or icons, to indicate links. Ensure that links remain distinguishable
  even when color is not available.
- **Color contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between link text and the
  surrounding text and background. Use a contrast checking tool to verify that
  the contrast ratio meets the minimum requirements.
- **Keyboard accessibility:** Make all links fully operable using the keyboard.
  Enable users to navigate to links using the Tab key. Allow users to activate
  links using the Enter key.
- **Link purpose:** Write link text that clearly describes the destination or
  purpose of the link. Avoid generic link text such as "click here" or "read
  more" without sufficient context. Ensure that the link's purpose is clear from
  the surrounding context.
- **Focus visible:** Provide a clear and visible focus indicator for links when
  they receive keyboard focus. Visually distinguish the focus state from the
  default state using outlines, highlights, or other visual cues. Avoid relying
  solely on color changes to indicate focus.
- **Language of parts:** If a link leads to content in a different language, use
  the `lang` attribute to indicate the language of the linked content.
- **On focus:** Prevent links from unexpectedly changing the context of the page
  when they receive focus. Ensure that any context changes are initiated by the
  user activating the link.
- **Name, role, value:** Use the `<a>` element correctly to define links. Ensure
  that assistive technologies can correctly interpret links and their
  attributes. Use ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`) when
  necessary to provide additional information to assistive technologies,
  especially for complex links or custom implementations.
