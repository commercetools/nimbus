# Link

A link is a clickable element that navigates users to another page, section of
the page, or resource, and is visually distinguished by styling.

## Overview

The link is flexible to many uses and matching text styles for common
placements. Most commonly used in dialog boxes, alerts, and within body copy.

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Size and text styling

Links should be within text, and should take on that styling when used, and
provide the additional link stylings to let the user know that the text is
interactive.

## Guidelines

Link guidelines ensure that interactive text or elements are clearly
identifiable, describe their destination or function, are keyboard accessible,
and maintain sufficient visual contrast for all users.

### Best practices

- **Links are meant to be used in inline placements, buttons are standalone
  elements.** Additionally, if you need an icon next to your link, use a link
  styled button instead of using a link and an icon.
- **Use links for navigation** rather than to complete an action. Links are
  tertiary actions should give users access to information or navigate to other
  pages when helpful to the user.
  - Stylized navigation like footers and nav items are more often buttons rather
    than links.
- **Use clear and concise text:** Use link text that accurately and concisely
  describes the destination or purpose of the link. Avoid generic phrases like
  "click here". Remember that translation will add 20% more length on average.
- **Accessibility:** Default color contrast passes accessibility guidelines, if
  customizing, please ensure your links pass color contrast guidelines. Use ARIA
  attributes to provide additional context to assistive technologies.

### Usage

Linked text, the clickable text that forms a hyperlink, should be used
strategically to enhance navigation and provide access to relevant information.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Navigation:** Users expect links to move them from to one location to
  another within a product. When moving outside the product or when opening a
  new page, use the
  [link styled button](/components/inputs/button#tertiary-actions).
- **Tertiary actions that need explanation:** when showing a user an error or
  explanation it is nice to offer a link for the user.
- **Contextual information:** To provide access to related content, definitions,
  or supporting materials.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Redundancy:** If the same destination can be reached through more intuitive
  navigation (e.g., menus, breadcrumbs).
- **Disrupting flow:** Overuse of links within paragraphs can disrupt the
  reading flow and make it difficult for users to focus on the main content.
- **Ambiguity:** If the link text is unclear or doesn't accurately describe the
  destination, it can lead to confusion and frustration.
- **Accessibility issues:** If links are not properly styled or labeled, they
  can be inaccessible to users with disabilities.

### Length of text

Keep text links short and accurately describe the action that will be taken.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Explain where the link will go clearly, but keep it short as possible.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Link href="#" size="sm" fontColor="primary">
    Manage permissions
  </Link>
 );
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not make an entire sentence a hyperlink.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Link href="#" size="sm" fontColor="primary">
    Click here to know all there is to know about making custom views in the Merchant Center.
  </Link>
 );
```

### Actions

Users expect links to navigate rather than submit actions. Do not use links to
do what a button would accomplish better.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Implementations like this are more familiar to the user. They will expect to navigate to the page where they can accomplish this action.

```jsx-live
const App = () =>  (
   <Box>
    There has been an issue with your payment.{" "}
    <Link href="#" fontColor="primary">
      Update payment
    </Link>
  </Box>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not use links for actions that buttons are more commonly used for.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
   <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center" gap="400" >
     <Link href="#" fontColor="primary">
      Save
     </Link>
     <Link href="#" fontColor="primary">
      Delete
     </Link>
  </Stack>
);
```

### Links inside alerts

Text links inherit colors depending on placement.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - If possible lead the user to where they can fix or learn more about what
>   happened so they might correct the action to complete their task.

```jsx-live
const App = () =>  (
  <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined" width="9600">
    <Alert.Description>
     Something went wrong. <Link>Read more</Link>
    </Alert.Description>
    <Alert.DismissButton />
  </Alert.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not link the entire message, do not have multiple sentences in a link.
> - Do not use default link colors when you can use inherited colors to provide
>   the best consistency for a user.

```jsx-live
const App = () =>(
  <Alert.Root tone="critical" variant="outlined" width="9600">
    <Alert.Description>
     <Link color="primary">Something went wrong. Read more</Link>
    </Alert.Description>
    <Alert.DismissButton />
  </Alert.Root>
);
```

### Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () =>  (
  <Link href="#" size="md" fontColor="primary">
    Click me... with your keyboard
  </Link>
 );
```

### Accessibility Standards

#### 1. Perceivable:

- **1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A):**
  - Provide text alternatives for any non-text content within or associated with
    links (e.g., icons embedded in links).
  - Use alt text for images within links and provide text equivalents for other
    non-text content.
- **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A):**
  - Avoid relying solely on color to distinguish links from surrounding text.
  - Provide additional visual cues, such as underlines, bold text, or icons, to
    indicate links.
  - Ensure that links remain distinguishable even when color is not available.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA):**
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast between link text and the surrounding text
    and background.
  - Use a contrast checking tool to verify that the contrast ratio meets the
    minimum requirements.

#### 2. Operable:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A):**
  - Make all links fully operable using the keyboard.
  - Enable users to navigate to links using the Tab key.
  - Allow users to activate links using the Enter key.
- **2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A):**
  - Write link text that clearly describes the destination or purpose of the
    link.
  - Avoid generic link text such as "click here" or "read more" without
    sufficient context.
  - Ensure that the link's purpose is clear from the surrounding context.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA):**
  - Provide a clear and visible focus indicator for links when they receive
    keyboard focus.
  - Visually distinguish the focus state from the default state using outlines,
    highlights, or other visual cues.
  - Avoid relying solely on color changes to indicate focus.

#### 3. Understandable:

- **3.1.2 Language of Parts (Level AA):**
  - If a link leads to content in a different language, use the lang attribute
    to indicate the language of the linked content.
- **3.2.1 On Focus (Level A):**
  - Prevent links from unexpectedly changing the context of the page when they
    receive focus.
  - Ensure that any context changes are initiated by the user activating the
    link.

#### 4. Robust:

- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A):**
  - Use the `<a>` element correctly to define links.
  - Ensure that assistive technologies can correctly interpret links and their
    attributes.
  - Use ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`) when necessary
    to provide additional information to assistive technologies, especially for
    complex links or custom implementations.
