# Link

A link is a clickable element that navigates users to another page, section of
the page, or resource, and is visually distinguished by styling.

## Overview

The link is flexible to many uses and matching text styles for common
placements. Most commonly used in dialog boxes, alerts, and within body copy.

### Resources

## Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Size and text styling

Links should be within text, and should take on that styling when used, and
provide the additional link stylings to let the user know that the text is
interactive.

## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx-live
const App = () =>  (
  <Link href="#" size="md" fontColor="primary">
    Click me... with your keyboard
  </Link>
 );
```

### Accessibility standards

#### 1. Perceivable:

- **1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A):**
  - Provide text alternatives for any non-text content within or associated with
    links (e.g., icons embedded in links).
  - Use alt text for images within links and provide text equivalents for other
    non-text content.
- **1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A):**
  - Avoid relying solely on color to distinguish links from surrounding text.
  - Provide additional visual cues, such as underlines, bold text, or icons, to
    indicate links.
  - Ensure that links remain distinguishable even when color is not available.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA):**
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast between link text and the surrounding text
    and background.
  - Use a contrast checking tool to verify that the contrast ratio meets the
    minimum requirements.

#### 2. Operable:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A):**
  - Make all links fully operable using the keyboard.
  - Enable users to navigate to links using the Tab key.
  - Allow users to activate links using the Enter key.
- **2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A):**
  - Write link text that clearly describes the destination or purpose of the
    link.
  - Avoid generic link text such as "click here" or "read more" without
    sufficient context.
  - Ensure that the link's purpose is clear from the surrounding context.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA):**
  - Provide a clear and visible focus indicator for links when they receive
    keyboard focus.
  - Visually distinguish the focus state from the default state using outlines,
    highlights, or other visual cues.
  - Avoid relying solely on color changes to indicate focus.

#### 3. Understandable:

- **3.1.2 Language of Parts (Level AA):**
  - If a link leads to content in a different language, use the lang attribute
    to indicate the language of the linked content.
- **3.2.1 On Focus (Level A):**
  - Prevent links from unexpectedly changing the context of the page when they
    receive focus.
  - Ensure that any context changes are initiated by the user activating the
    link.

#### 4. Robust:

- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A):**
  - Use the `<a>` element correctly to define links.
  - Ensure that assistive technologies can correctly interpret links and their
    attributes.
  - Use ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`) when necessary
    to provide additional information to assistive technologies, especially for
    complex links or custom implementations.
