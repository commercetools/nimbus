## Guidelines

Link guidelines ensure that interactive text or elements are clearly
identifiable, describe their destination or function, are keyboard accessible,
and maintain sufficient visual contrast for all users.

### Best practices

- **Links are meant to be used in inline placements, buttons are standalone
  elements.** Additionally, if you need an icon next to your link, use a link
  styled button instead of using a link and an icon.
- **Use links for navigation** rather than to complete an action. Links are
  tertiary actions should give users access to information or navigate to other
  pages when helpful to the user.
  - Stylized navigation like footers and nav items are more often buttons rather
    than links.
- **Use clear and concise text:** Use link text that accurately and concisely
  describes the destination or purpose of the link. Avoid generic phrases like
  "click here". Remember that translation will add 20% more length on average.
- **Accessibility:** Default color contrast passes accessibility guidelines, if
  customizing, please ensure your links pass color contrast guidelines. Use ARIA
  attributes to provide additional context to assistive technologies.

### Usage

Linked text, the clickable text that forms a hyperlink, should be used
strategically to enhance navigation and provide access to relevant information.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Navigation:** Users expect links to move them from to one location to
  another within a product. When moving outside the product or when opening a
  new page, use the
  [link styled button](/components/inputs/button#tertiary-actions).
- **Tertiary actions that need explanation:** when showing a user an error or
  explanation it is nice to offer a link for the user.
- **Contextual information:** To provide access to related content, definitions,
  or supporting materials.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Redundancy:** If the same destination can be reached through more intuitive
  navigation (e.g., menus, breadcrumbs).
- **Disrupting flow:** Overuse of links within paragraphs can disrupt the
  reading flow and make it difficult for users to focus on the main content.
- **Ambiguity:** If the link text is unclear or doesn't accurately describe the
  destination, it can lead to confusion and frustration.
- **Accessibility issues:** If links are not properly styled or labeled, they
  can be inaccessible to users with disabilities.

### Length of text

Keep text links short and accurately describe the action that will be taken.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Explain where the link will go clearly, but keep it short as possible.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Link href="#" size="sm" fontColor="primary">
    Manage permissions
  </Link>
 );
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not make an entire sentence a hyperlink.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Link href="#" size="sm" fontColor="primary">
    Click here to know all there is to know about making custom views in the Merchant Center.
  </Link>
 );
```

### Actions

Users expect links to navigate rather than submit actions. Do not use links to
do what a button would accomplish better.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Implementations like this are more familiar to the user. They will expect to
>   navigate to the page where they can accomplish this action.

```jsx live
const App = () =>  (
   <Box>
    There has been an issue with your payment.{" "}
    <Link href="#" fontColor="primary">
      Update payment
    </Link>
  </Box>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not use links for actions that buttons are more commonly used for.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
   <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center" gap="400" >
     <Link href="#" fontColor="primary">
      Save
     </Link>
     <Link href="#" fontColor="primary">
      Delete
     </Link>
  </Stack>
);
```

### Links inside alerts

Text links inherit colors depending on placement.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - If possible lead the user to where they can fix or learn more about what
>   happened so they might correct the action to complete their task.

```jsx live
const App = () =>  (
  <Alert.Root colorPalette="critical" variant="outlined" width="9600">
    <Alert.Description>
     Something went wrong. <Link>Read more</Link>
    </Alert.Description>
    <Alert.DismissButton />
  </Alert.Root>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not link the entire message, do not have multiple sentences in a link.
> - Do not use default link colors when you can use inherited colors to provide
>   the best consistency for a user.

```jsx live
const App = () =>(
  <Alert.Root colorPalette="critical" variant="outlined" width="9600">
    <Alert.Description>
     <Link color="primary">Something went wrong. Read more</Link>
    </Alert.Description>
    <Alert.DismissButton />
  </Alert.Root>
);
```
