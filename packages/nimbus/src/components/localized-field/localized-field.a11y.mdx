## Accessibility

Accessibility ensures that digital content and functionality are usable by
everyone, including people with disabilities, by addressing visual, auditory,
cognitive, and physical limitations.

```jsx live
const App = () => {
  const [values, setValues] = useState({ en: 'Hello world', de: 'Hallo Welt' });

  return (

      <LocalizedField
        size="md"
        defaultLocaleOrCurrency="en"
        valuesByLocaleOrCurrency={values}
        onChange={(e) => {
          setValues({
            ...values,
            [e.target.locale]: e.target.value
          });
        }}
      />

  );
};
```

### Accessibility standards

- **Focus management:** Ensure the Tab order moves logically between the active
  input field and the language switching controls. When the language is
  switched, focus should return to the newly visible input field.
- **Keyboard operability:** The language switching controls (tabs, buttons) must
  be fully navigable and operable via the keyboard.
- **ARIA roles:** Ensure the active input field correctly inherits all necessary
  ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-required, aria-invalid) from the FormField
  component.
- **Screen reader communication:** Ensure screen readers announce the change of
  language context when the user activates a different locale input, often by
  announcing the new tab or language code.
