## Accessibility

The component uses onPress\* props to handle all user interactions—mouse clicks,
touch taps, and keyboard presses—consistently. These props (onPress,
onPressStart, onPressEnd, etc.) ensure a smooth and accessible experience
regardless of the user's input method or device.

```jsx-live
const App = () => <TextInput placeholder="XX/XX/XXXX" />
```

### Accessibility standards

**1. Perceivable:**

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships:** Use proper HTML (`<label>`,
  `aria-labelledby`, etc.) to connect labels with their inputs. This helps
  assistive technologies (like screen readers) understand the connection and
  convey the information correctly.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):** Ensure sufficient color contrast between the
  input field, its label, and the surrounding background. This makes it easier
  to read for people with low vision. The minimum contrast ratio is 4.5:1 for
  normal text and 3:1 for large text.

**2. Operable:**

- **2.1.1 Keyboard:** Text inputs must be fully operable using only a keyboard
  (no mouse required). This includes navigating to the input, interacting with
  it, and submitting the form.
- **2.4.6 Headings and Labels:** Labels should be clear, concise, and
  descriptive, accurately reflecting the purpose of the input field.

**3. Understandable:**

- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions:** Provide clear labels or instructions to help
  users understand what type of information is expected in the input field.

**4. Robust:**

- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value:** Ensure the input field's name (label), role (type
  of input), and current value are programmatically available to assistive
  technologies.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Error Messages:** When input errors occur, provide clear and specific error
  messages that are easy to understand and locate. Use ARIA attributes
  (`aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`) to associate error messages with the
  input field.
- **Placeholder Text:** While placeholder text can be helpful, it can also
  create accessibility issues. Avoid using it as a replacement for labels, and
  ensure sufficient color contrast if you do use it.
- **Autocomplete:** Autocomplete can improve usability, but make sure it doesn't
  interfere with accessibility. Users should be able to easily review and
  override suggestions.
