## Guidelines

Text input guidelines focus on creating clear, accessible, and user-friendly
fields for data entry by emphasizing proper labeling, providing helpful cues and
validation, ensuring keyboard navigation, and offering clear feedback on input
status.

### Best practices

- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - Ensure that text inputs are fully keyboard accessible (using the Tab key to
    navigate).
- **Error Handling:**
  - Provide clear and specific error messages when invalid input is entered.
  - Display error messages close to the input field.
- **Placeholder text:**
  - Avoid relying solely on placeholder text, as it disappears when the user
    starts typing.
  - Make use of clear labels and helper text if clarifying information is
    needed.

### Placeholder text

Good placeholder text informs the user what to expect and can easily understand
the difference between placeholder and pre-filled content.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Provide hints:** Use placeholder text to give users a brief hint or example
  of the expected input format.
- **Keep it concise:** Placeholder text should be short and to the point. Avoid
  long sentences or paragraphs.
- **Use a subtle visual style:** Visually differentiate placeholder text from
  actual input text by using the placeholder text styling. This helps users
  understand that it's a suggestion, not a pre-filled value.  

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Don't use as labels:** Placeholder text should never replace proper labels.
  Labels provide persistent context, while placeholder text disappears when the
  user starts typing.  
- **Don't include critical information:** Avoid putting essential instructions
  or information solely in the placeholder, as it will be hidden once the user
  interacts with the field.  
- **Don't overuse:** Too much placeholder text can clutter the interface and
  make it harder for users to focus.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Give the user a hint on what is expected, in a concise way.
> - If this information is important to always keep visible, use helper text
>   instead.

```jsx live
const App = () => <TextInput placeholder="MM/DD/YYYY"/>
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - This placeholder text looks like it has been prefilled for the user which is
>   more likely to confuse the user.

```jsx live
const App = () => <TextInput placeholder="01/21/1970"/>
```

### Size

Allow for enough width for the user to read and add in their information. Avoid
truncation if possible especially if the user will be referring back or needing
to make sure there isn’t inaccurate information.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use
>
> - There is enough space that the user can easily consume and correct this
>   information if needed.

```jsx live
const App = () => <TextInput placeholder="01/21/1970" value="805 St Cloud Road"/>
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - The user’s information is too long for this field to be able to read the
>   details completely.

```jsx live
const App = () => <TextInput value="805 St Cloud Road, Bel Air, Los Angeles, CA" />
```
