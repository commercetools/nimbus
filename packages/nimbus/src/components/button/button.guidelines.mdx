# Button Guidelines

Buttons are essential interactive elements that empower users to trigger actions
and navigate within your product. They serve as clear calls to action, guiding
users through key flows and enabling them to interact with content in meaningful
ways. These guidelines ensure consistent styling and behavior for all buttons,
contributing to a cohesive and predictable user experience.

## Writing guidelines

- A good button label tells you exactly what will happen when you click it,
  making the whole experience more intuitive and enjoyable.
- Use concise and clear action based language for all buttons.
- Use sentence case, capitalize the first word and use lowercase for the rest.
- Be aware that with localization/translation character count will add on
  average 20% more length.

## Preferred words

| **Text**                                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Save**                                | Carries out pending changes, commits to saving the information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Back**                                | This term typically implies a return to a previous state or location in a non-linear or less structured flow. It's often used for:<ul style={{listStyle: "disc", marginLeft: "20px"}}><li>Navigating browser history</li><li>Exiting a screen or section</li></ul>                                                     |
| **Previous**                            | This term is more common in linear, sequential flows, such as: <ul style={{listStyle: "disc", marginLeft: "20px"}}><li>Stepping through a list of items</li><li>Moving between pages in a paginated view</li><li>Progressing through a multi-step process</li></ul> <br />Pair "Previous" with "Next" button language. |
| **Add new (noun)**                      | Establishes a new object from scratch. Always followed by an object. For example "add product" "add category".<br/><br/>Can also be used in areas that establishes a new relationship. Example "add products to a category".<br/><br/>Do not use "add new" as it does not give full context.                           |
| **Revert changes**                      | "Revert" stops an action without saving pending changes. When paired with a form it should return the information to the previously saved state. Never make Revert changes red, it is not a destructive action.                                                                                                        |
| **Cancel**                              | "Cancel" stops an action without saving pending changes. Never make Cancel red, it is not a destructive action. Cancel should be outline, ghost or link button.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Delete or Delete (X nouns)**          | Deletes a data so a user can no longer retrieve it. This is different from Remove.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Remove**                              | Removes a relationship, but does not permanently delete data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Expand/Collapse Show more/Show less** | Expands or collapses further details and information. No capitalization is needed for these placements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Avoid these words

| **Text**                      | **Use this instead**                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New**                       | Be more specific about what the user is creating.                                |
| **Continue**                  | Use "Next" instead of "Continue" instead to maintain consistency.                |
| **Create new (noun)**         | Use "Add (noun)" instead of "create" in button language to maintain consistency. |
| **OK, Sure, Fine, Yes, No**   | Use words that explain the action.                                               |
| **Wow! Yes? DELETE NOW! No?** | Avoid full capitalization and punctuation.                                       |

## Usage

**A primary filled button** highlights the most important action a user can
take. For example, it might be used to save changes, submit a form, or emphasize
a key action like adding a discount.

**Secondary and tertiary** (primary color palette with outline and linked styling) buttons
are used when there's already a primary action on the page. They're for less
prominent actions, like canceling changes, supporting the primary action, going
back in a process, or expanding/collapsing information.

**Buttons with 'critical' color palette** are reserved for destructive actions, such as
deleting something or removing a connection.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Trigger an action:** Anything that happens (save, delete, submit, download,
  etc.).
- **Control a process:** Start, stop, pause, resume, undo, redo.
- **Confirm a choice:** "Yes," "Save changes," Confirm.
- **Open something:** Modal, popover, dialog.
- **Select an option:** Especially complex or visual choices.
  <br />

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Navigation:** Use links, not buttons, for page/section navigation.
- **Too many:** Avoid button overload; group actions or use menus.
- **Simple actions:** Icons suffice for basic actions (e.g., close, play/pause).
- **Non-interactive:** Don't make non-clickable elements look like buttons.
- **Accessibility:** Misusing buttons confuses assistive tech.
- **Visual clutter:** Too many button styles dilute meaning.
- **Progressive disclosure:** Reveal options gradually for complex tasks.
- **Data display:** Use labels, not buttons, for showing info.
- **Simpler controls:** Use checkboxes, radios, toggles when appropriate.
- **Too much text:** Truncate text if translation is too long, but look for
  better solutions or different wording.

## Icons in buttons

Icons that are on the left are the best placement. Icons are used to lead the
user to the right action quickly by scanning. Ok ways to break this rule are
with drop downs and right pointing arrows.

<br />

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use the correct and consistently patterned icon for the action that a user
>   will be selecting.
> - Ok ways to break this rule are with drop downs and right pointing arrows.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.Undo />
      Revert
    </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.FileUpload />
      Upload
   </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.Add />
      Add product
   </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="outline">
      <Icons.ArrowBack />
      Previous
   </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      Next
      <Icons.ArrowForward />
   </Button>
 </Stack>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Icons should represent the action the user will be taking.
> - Don't use two icons to represent an action. One icon will do.
> - Left icons are the default unless there is directional reason.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.Upload />
       Delete
      <Icons.Upload />
    </Button>
    <Button colorPalette="critical" size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.Clear />
        Add discount
      <Icons.Clear />
    </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      Revert
      <Icons.Undo />
    </Button>
 </Stack>
)
```

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use right icons to build a drop down component with the Popover component.
> - Icons are on the left unless there is a directional reason to use a right
>   icon placement.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Stack>
      <Button size="md" variant="outline">
        Save changes
        <Icons.KeyboardArrowDown />
      </Button>
     <Card.Root elevation="elevated" cardPadding="md">
        <Card.Content>
        <div style={{fontSize: "16px", fontWeight: "400"}}>
        <p>Save</p>
        <p>Save and publish</p>
        <p>Save and open next</p>
        </div>
        </Card.Content>
      </Card.Root>
    </Stack>
    <Stack>
      <Button size="md" variant="solid">

    </Stack>
  </Stack>
);
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Dropdown icons should always be on the right side.
> - Don't place action describing icons on the right if a drop down is wanted.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Stack>
      {['2xs','xs','md'].map((size) => (
        <Stack key={size} direction="horizontal">
          <Button size={size} colorPalette="positive" variant="solid" startIcon={<Icons.Check />}>
            <Icons.Check />

```

## Button groupings

Button groups are UI elements that organize multiple buttons together, often
visually as a single unit. They serve to present users with a set of related
choices or actions in a compact and organized way.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - This is the correct hierarchy of button groupings. From right to left,
>   Primary, Outlined, and Link button.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button as="a" size="md" variant="link">
      Cancel and close
    </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="outline">
      <Icons.Undo />
      Revert
    </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      Save changes
    </Button>
  </Stack>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Avoid stacking actions.
> - Don't use two buttons with the primary color palette in the same area.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button size="md" colorPalette="primary" variant="solid">
      Save changes
    </Button>
    <Button size="md" colorPalette="primary" variant="solid">
      <Icons.Undo />
      Revert
    </Button>
    <Button size="md" colorPalette="primary" variant="ghost">
      Cancel and close
    </Button>
  </Stack>
)
```

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Place the filled primary button to the right. This should represent the
>   action most likely taken by a user.
> - Outlined secondary button to the left of the primary action.
> - Icon is on the left of the button.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button size="md" variant="outline">
      <Icons.Undo />
      Revert
    </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      Save
    </Button>
  </Stack>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not place the filled primary button to the left of another option.
> - Do not have two primary filled buttons near each other.
> - Do not include punctuation in buttons.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      Cancel!
    </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      Save.
    </Button>
    <Button as="a" size="sm" variant="link">
      External link
      <Icons.Launch />
    </Button>
  </Stack>
)
```

## Button links

These actions are likely seen when an action is optional to have more or less
information shown.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Expand actions should be placed at the lower center or left hand side of the
>   element that will expand/collapse.
> - Link button is using the correct size, 2x-small.

```jsx-live
 const App = () => (
  <>
   <div style={{
     width: "300px",
     height: "40px",
     backgroundColor: "#f0f8ff",
     border: "1px dashed #60a5fa",
     borderRadius: "12px",
     display: "flex",
     justifyContent: "center",
     alignItems: "center",
     position: "relative",
   }}>
     <span style={{
       fontSize: "10px",
       color: "#3b82f6",
       letterSpacing: "1px",
     }}>Trigger</span>
  </div>
    <Button as="a" size="2xs" variant="link" marginLeft="220px">
      <Icons.KeyboardArrowDown />
      expand
    </Button>
</>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - The button is too large for this placement
> - Expansion icons should be placed to the left side of the label to allow for
>   easier scanning by a user.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (
  <>
   <div style={{
     width: "300px",
     height: "40px",
     backgroundColor: "#f0f8ff",
     border: "1px dashed #60a5fa",
     borderRadius: "12px",
     display: "flex",
     justifyContent: "center",
     alignItems: "center",
     position: "relative",
   }}>
     <span style={{
       fontSize: "10px",
       color: "#3b82f6",
       letterSpacing: "1px",
     }}>Trigger</span>
  </div>
    <Button as="a" size="md" variant="link" marginLeft="200px">
      expand
      <Icons.KeyboardArrowDown />
    </Button>
</>
)
```
