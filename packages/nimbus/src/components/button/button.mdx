## Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that initiate actions. They're how we encourage
users to take action and explore different parts of our interface.

### Hierarchy

#### Primary actions

Primary colorPalette, filled style, medium size. For the principal call to action on the
page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen.

- **A solid button** should be used as a primary action on a page used to
  highlight the most important or most common action a user is likely to take in
  that context. It serves to guide the user towards the desired path and make
  the key interaction clear and prominent.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Button colorPalette="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
   <Icons.Add />
   Primary action
 </Button>
)
```

#### Secondary actions

Primary color palette, outline style, medium size. Represents a less important or
alternative action compared to the primary button.

- **An outlined button** should be used as for secondary actions that are less
  important or less frequent than the primary action. They provide users with
  alternative options without distracting from the main call to action.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Button colorPalette="primary" variant="outline" size="md">
   <Icons.Replay />
   Secondary action
 </Button>
)
```

#### Tertiary actions

Primary color palette, link styled, xsmall size. For lesser-performed actions or a
collection of actions — those that users are unlikely to perform.

- **Ghost buttons** are used when you want a button to be visible but less
  visually prominent than a primary or secondary button. These can apply to
  tertiary actions such as drop downs and contextual actions.
- **Link buttons** can be used when the focus should be on the content rather
  than the UI controls themselves. They are less visually distracting and allow
  the content to take center stage. This is common in content-heavy applications
  or dashboards. Link and Ghost styled buttons are most used in tertiary
  actions, and are styled in X-small or 2X-small sizes.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
    <Button size="md" variant="ghost">
      Filter
    </Button>
    <Button size="xs" variant="link">
      Expand options
      <Icons.KeyboardArrowDown />
   </Button>
 </Stack>
)
```

### Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Icons in buttons

#### Icons before or after in buttons

The default position of icons in primary and secondary buttons are to the left
of the text, but we allow for icons to follow for special uses such as drop
downs, steppers, and expansion links. For icon placement best practices refer to
our guidelines.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Solid
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
    </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="outline">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Outline
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
   </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Ghost
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
   </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="link">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Link
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
   </Button>
 </Stack>
)
```

### Size

**Medium** (40px)

This is the default and preferred size for buttons.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Button size="md" variant="solid">
   Save
 </Button>
)
```

**X-Small** (32px)

If there is a space constraint, use these buttons. Ideally will be used
sparingly.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
 <Button size="xs" variant="solid">
   Apply filters
 </Button>
)
```

**2x-Small** (24px)

Used mainly for Ghost and Link buttons, these buttons can be seen in filters
where the size constraint is tightest.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Button size="2xs" variant="ghost">
   <Icons.Edit />
   Edit Filters
 </Button>
)
```

### Color palette

#### Primary

This is the default `colorPalette` for the primary button. This styling should be used
most commonly for all actions.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Button size="md" variant="solid">
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Button
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
  </Button>
)
```

#### Critical

Use this button when the user is approaching a permanent destructive action.

```jsx live
const App = () => (
  <Button colorPalette="critical" size="md" variant="solid">
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Button
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
  </Button>
)
```
