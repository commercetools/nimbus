# Button

A button serves as a standardized, reusable component for triggering actions and
navigating.

## Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that initiate actions. They're how we encourage
users to take action and explore different parts of our interface.

### Hierarchy

#### Primary actions

Primary tone, filled style, medium size. For the principal call to action on the
page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen.

- **A solid button** should be used as a primary action on a page used to
  highlight the most important or most common action a user is likely to take in
  that context. It serves to guide the user towards the desired path and make
  the key interaction clear and prominent.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button colorPalette="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
   <Icons.Add />
   Primary action
 </Button>
)
```

#### Secondary actions

Primary tone, outline style, medium size. Represents a less important or
alternative action compared to the primary button.

- **An outlined button** should be used as for secondary actions that are less
  important or less frequent than the primary action. They provide users with
  alternative options without distracting from the main call to action.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button tone="primary" colorPalette="primary" variant="outline" size="md">
   <Icons.Replay />
   Secondary action
 </Button>
)
```

#### Tertiary actions

Primary tone, link styled, xsmall size. For lesser-performed actions or a
collection of actions — those that users are unlikely to perform.

- **Ghost buttons** are used when you want a button to be visible but less
  visually prominent than a primary or secondary button. These can apply to
  tertiary actions such as drop downs and contextual actions.
- **Link buttons** can be used when the focus should be on the content rather
  than the UI controls themselves. They are less visually distracting and allow
  the content to take center stage. This is common in content-heavy applications
  or dashboards. Link and Ghost styled buttons are most used in tertiary
  actions, and are styled in X-small or 2X-small sizes.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="ghost">
      Filter
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="xs" variant="link">
      Expand options
      <Icons.KeyboardArrowDown />
   </Button>
 </Stack>
)
```

### Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Icons in buttons

#### Icons before or after in buttons

The default position of icons in primary and secondary buttons are to the left
of the text, but we allow for icons to follow for special uses such as drop
downs, steppers, and expansion links. For icon placement best practices refer to
our guidelines.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Solid
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="outline">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Outline
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
   </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Ghost
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
   </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="link">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Link
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
   </Button>
 </Stack>
)
```

### Size

**Medium** (40px)

This is the default and preferred size for buttons.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button colorPalette="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
   Save
 </Button>
)
```

**X-Small** (32px)

If there is a space constraint, use these buttons. Ideally will be used
sparingly.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
 <Button colorPalette="primary" size="xs" variant="solid">
   Apply filters
 </Button>
)
```

**2x-Small** (24px)

Used mainly for Ghost and Link buttons, these buttons can be seen in filters
where the size constraint is tightest.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button colorPalette="primary" size="2xs" variant="ghost">
   <Icons.Edit />
   Edit Filters
 </Button>
)
```

### Tone

#### Primary

This is the default tone for the primary button. This styling should be used
most commonly for all actions.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Button
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
  </Button>
)
```

#### Critical

Use this button when the user is approaching a permanent destructive action.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button tone="critical" size="md" variant="solid">
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Button
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
  </Button>
)
```

## Guidelines

Buttons are essential interactive elements that empower users to trigger actions
and navigate within your product. They serve as clear calls to action, guiding
users through key flows and enabling them to interact with content in meaningful
ways. These guidelines ensure consistent styling and behavior for all buttons,
contributing to a cohesive and predictable user experience.

### Writing guidelines

- A good button label tells you exactly what will happen when you click it,
  making the whole experience more intuitive and enjoyable.
- Use concise and clear action based language for all buttons.
- Use sentence case, capitalize the first word and use lowercase for the rest.
- Be aware that with localization/translation character count will add on
  average 20% more length.

### Preferred words

| **Text**                                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Save**                                | Carries out pending changes, commits to saving the information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Back**                                | This term typically implies a return to a previous state or location in a non-linear or less structured flow. It's often used for:<ul style={{listStyle: "disc", marginLeft: "20px"}}><li>Navigating browser history</li><li>Exiting a screen or section</li></ul>                                                     |
| **Previous**                            | This term is more common in linear, sequential flows, such as: <ul style={{listStyle: "disc", marginLeft: "20px"}}><li>Stepping through a list of items</li><li>Moving between pages in a paginated view</li><li>Progressing through a multi-step process</li></ul> <br />Pair “Previous” with “Next” button language. |
| **Add new (noun)**                      | Establishes a new object from scratch. Always followed by an object. For example “add product” “add category”.<br/><br/>Can also be used in areas that establishes a new relationship. Example “add products to a category”.<br/><br/>Do not use “add new” as it does not give full context.                           |
| **Revert changes**                      | “Revert” stops an action without saving pending changes. When paired with a form it should return the information to the previously saved state. Never make Revert changes red, it is not a destructive action.                                                                                                        |
| **Cancel**                              | “Cancel” stops an action without saving pending changes. Never make Cancel red, it is not a destructive action. Cancel should be outline, ghost or link button.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Delete or Delete (X nouns)**          | Deletes a data so a user can no longer retrieve it. This is different from Remove.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Remove**                              | Removes a relationship, but does not permanently delete data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Expand/Collapse Show more/Show less** | Expands or collapses further details and information. No capitalization is needed for these placements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Avoid these words

| **Text**                      | **Use this instead**                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New**                       | Be more specific about what the user is creating.                                |
| **Continue**                  | Use “Next” instead of “Continue” instead to maintain consistency.                |
| **Create new (noun)**         | Use “Add (noun)” instead of “create” in button language to maintain consistency. |
| **OK, Sure, Fine, Yes, No**   | Use words that explain the action.                                               |
| **Wow! Yes? DELETE NOW! No?** | Avoid full capitalization and punctuation.                                       |

### Usage

**A primary filled button** highlights the most important action a user can
take. For example, it might be used to save changes, submit a form, or emphasize
a key action like adding a discount.

**Secondary and tertiary** (primary toned outline and linked styling) buttons
are used when there's already a primary action on the page. They're for less
prominent actions, like canceling changes, supporting the primary action, going
back in a process, or expanding/collapsing information.

**Critically toned buttons** are reserved for destructive actions, such as
deleting something or removing a connection.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- **Trigger an action:** Anything that happens (save, delete, submit, download,
  etc.).
- **Control a process:** Start, stop, pause, resume, undo, redo.
- **Confirm a choice:** "Yes," "Save changes," Confirm.
- **Open something:** Modal, popover, dialog.
- **Select an option:** Especially complex or visual choices.
  <br />

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- **Navigation:** Use links, not buttons, for page/section navigation.
- **Too many:** Avoid button overload; group actions or use menus.
- **Simple actions:** Icons suffice for basic actions (e.g., close, play/pause).
- **Non-interactive:** Don't make non-clickable elements look like buttons.
- **Accessibility:** Misusing buttons confuses assistive tech.
- **Visual clutter:** Too many button styles dilute meaning.
- **Progressive disclosure:** Reveal options gradually for complex tasks.
- **Data display:** Use labels, not buttons, for showing info.
- **Simpler controls:** Use checkboxes, radios, toggles when appropriate.
- **Too much text:** Truncate text if translation is too long, but look for
  better solutions or different wording.

### Icons in buttons

Icons that are on the left are the best placement. Icons are used to lead the
user to the right action quickly by scanning. Ok ways to break this rule are
with drop downs and right pointing arrows.

<br />

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use the correct and consistently patterned icon for the action that a user
>   will be selecting.
> - Ok ways to break this rule are with drop downs and right pointing arrows.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (

    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.Undo />
      Revert
    </Button>

    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      Next
      <Icons.ArrowForward />
   </Button>
 </Stack>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Icons should represent the action the user will be taking.
> - Don’t use two icons to represent an action. One icon will do.
> - Left icons are the default unless there is directional reason.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.Upload />
       Delete

    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      Revert
      <Icons.Undo />
    </Button>
 </Stack>
)
```

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Use right icons to build a drop down component with the Popover component.
> - Icons are on the left unless there is a directional reason to use a right
>   icon placement.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">

    </Stack>
  </Stack>
);
```

### Button groupings

Button groups are UI elements that organize multiple buttons together, often
visually as a single unit. They serve to present users with a set of related
choices or actions in a compact and organized way.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - This is the correct hierarchy of button groupings. From right to left,
>   Primary, Outlined, and Link button.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button tone="primary" as="a" size="md" variant="link">
      Cancel and close
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="outline">
      <Icons.Undo />
      Revert
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      Save changes
    </Button>
  </Stack>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Avoid stacking actions.
> - Don’t use two filled primary toned buttons in the same area.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      Save changes
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.Undo />
      Revert
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="ghost">
      Cancel and close
    </Button>
  </Stack>
)
```

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Place the filled primary button to the right. This should represent the
>   action most likely taken by a user.
> - Outlined secondary button to the left of the primary action.
> - Icon is on the left of the button.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="outline">
      <Icons.Undo />
      Revert
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      Save
    </Button>
  </Stack>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Do not place the filled primary button to the left of another option.
> - Do not have two primary filled buttons near each other.
> - Do not include punctuation in buttons.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      Cancel!
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
      Save.
    </Button>
    <Button tone="primary" as="a" size="sm" variant="link">
      External link
      <Icons.Launch />
    </Button>
  </Stack>
)
```

### Button links

These actions are likely seen when an action is optional to have more or less
information shown.

> [!TIP]\
> **Do**
>
> - Expand actions should be placed at the lower center or left hand side of the
>   element that will expand/collapse.
> - Link button is using the correct size, 2x-small.

```jsx-live
 const App = () => (
  <>
   <div style={{
     width: "300px",
     height: "40px",
     backgroundColor: "#f0f8ff",
     border: "1px dashed #60a5fa",
     borderRadius: "12px",
     display: "flex",
     justifyContent: "center",
     alignItems: "center",
     position: "relative",
   }}>
     <span style={{
       fontSize: "10px",
       color: "#3b82f6",
       letterSpacing: "1px",
     }}>Trigger</span>
  </div>
    <Button tone="primary" as="a" size="2xs" variant="link" marginLeft="220px">
      <Icons.KeyboardArrowDown />
      expand
    </Button>
</>
)
```

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - The button is too large for this placement
> - Expansion icons should be placed to the left side of the label to allow for
>   easier scanning by a user.

```jsx-live
  const App = () => (

### Specs


<PropTable id="Button" />

### Accessibility

The Button component uses `onPress\*` props to handle all user
interactions—mouse clicks, touch taps, and keyboard presses—consistently. These
props (`onPress`, `onPressStart`, `onPressEnd`, etc.) ensure a smooth and
accessible experience regardless of the user's input method or device.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button tone="primary" size="md" variant="solid" onPress={() => alert("clicked!")}>
    Click me... with your keyboard
  </Button>
)
```

### Accessibility Standards

#### 1. Perceivable:

- **Sufficient Color Contrast:**
  - **Text on Button:** The contrast ratio between the button text and the
    button background should be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large
    text.
  - **Button to Background:** The contrast ratio between the button's background
    color and the surrounding page background should be at least 3:1.
- **Visual Cues:** Don't rely solely on color to convey information. Use
  additional visual cues like shapes, patterns, or text labels to ensure the
  button's meaning is clear to everyone, including people with color blindness.
- **Focus Indicator:** Provide a clear visual indicator when the button receives
  keyboard focus. This helps users understand which element is currently active.
  - **WCAG 2.2 has specific criteria for focus indicators:**
    - **2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (Level AA):** The focus indicator
      must not be hidden by other content on the page.
    - **2.4.13 Focus Appearance (Minimum) (Level AA):** The focus indicator must
      meet certain visibility requirements to be easily seen.

#### 2. Operable:

- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Buttons must be operable using a keyboard. Users
  should be able to navigate to the button using the Tab key and activate it
  using the Enter or Space key.  
- **Target Size:** Ensure that the button is large enough to be easily
  clickable, especially on touchscreens. WCAG recommends a minimum target size
  of 24x24 CSS pixels.
- **Dragging Movements (2.5.7 Level AA):** If a button's function relies on
  dragging, an alternative method should be provided that doesn't require
  dragging.

#### 3. Understandable:

- **Clear Labels:** The button's text label should clearly describe its
  function.
- **Consistent Design:** Use buttons consistently throughout your website. This
  helps users learn the meaning of each button and makes it easier for them to
  navigate your site.
- **Findable Help (3.2.6 Level A):** If users might need help understanding how
  to use a button or what it does, provide clear and easily findable help
  resources.

#### 4. Robust:

- **Assistive Technology Compatibility:** Ensure that buttons are compatible
  with assistive technologies like screen readers. This often involves using
  proper HTML markup and ARIA attributes to provide semantic information about
  the button.
