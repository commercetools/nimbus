# Button

A button serves as a standardized, reusable component for triggering actions and
navigating.

## Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that initiate actions. They're how we encourage
users to take action and explore different parts of our interface.

### Hierarchy

#### Primary actions

Primary colorPalette, filled style, medium size. For the principal call to action on the
page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen.

- **A solid button** should be used as a primary action on a page used to
  highlight the most important or most common action a user is likely to take in
  that context. It serves to guide the user towards the desired path and make
  the key interaction clear and prominent.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button colorPalette="primary" size="md" variant="solid">
   <Icons.Add />
   Primary action
 </Button>
)
```

#### Secondary actions

Primary color palette, outline style, medium size. Represents a less important or
alternative action compared to the primary button.

- **An outlined button** should be used as for secondary actions that are less
  important or less frequent than the primary action. They provide users with
  alternative options without distracting from the main call to action.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button colorPalette="primary" variant="outline" size="md">
   <Icons.Replay />
   Secondary action
 </Button>
)
```

#### Tertiary actions

Primary color palette, link styled, xsmall size. For lesser-performed actions or a
collection of actions — those that users are unlikely to perform.

- **Ghost buttons** are used when you want a button to be visible but less
  visually prominent than a primary or secondary button. These can apply to
  tertiary actions such as drop downs and contextual actions.
- **Link buttons** can be used when the focus should be on the content rather
  than the UI controls themselves. They are less visually distracting and allow
  the content to take center stage. This is common in content-heavy applications
  or dashboards. Link and Ghost styled buttons are most used in tertiary
  actions, and are styled in X-small or 2X-small sizes.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
    <Button size="md" variant="ghost">
      Filter
    </Button>
    <Button size="xs" variant="link">
      Expand options
      <Icons.KeyboardArrowDown />
   </Button>
 </Stack>
)
```

### Variables

Get familiar with the features.

### Icons in buttons

#### Icons before or after in buttons

The default position of icons in primary and secondary buttons are to the left
of the text, but we allow for icons to follow for special uses such as drop
downs, steppers, and expansion links. For icon placement best practices refer to
our guidelines.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Stack direction="horizontal">
    <Button size="md" variant="solid">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Solid
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
    </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="outline">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Outline
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
   </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="ghost">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Ghost
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
   </Button>
    <Button size="md" variant="link">
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Link
      <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
   </Button>
 </Stack>
)
```

### Size

**Medium** (40px)

This is the default and preferred size for buttons.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button size="md" variant="solid">
   Save
 </Button>
)
```

**X-Small** (32px)

If there is a space constraint, use these buttons. Ideally will be used
sparingly.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
 <Button size="xs" variant="solid">
   Apply filters
 </Button>
)
```

**2x-Small** (24px)

Used mainly for Ghost and Link buttons, these buttons can be seen in filters
where the size constraint is tightest.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button size="2xs" variant="ghost">
   <Icons.Edit />
   Edit Filters
 </Button>
)
```

### Color Palette

#### Primary

This is the default `colorPalette` for the primary button. This styling should be used
most commonly for all actions.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button size="md" variant="solid">
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Button
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
  </Button>
)
```

#### Critical

Use this button when the user is approaching a permanent destructive action.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button colorPalette="critical" size="md" variant="solid">
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
      Button
    <Icons.SentimentSatisfied />
  </Button>
)
```

### Accessibility

The Button component uses `onPress\*` props to handle all user
interactions—mouse clicks, touch taps, and keyboard presses—consistently. These
props (`onPress`, `onPressStart`, `onPressEnd`, etc.) ensure a smooth and
accessible experience regardless of the user's input method or device.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button size="md" variant="solid" onPress={() => alert("clicked!")}>
    Click me... with your keyboard
  </Button>
)
```

### Accessibility standards

#### 1. Perceivable:

- **Sufficient Color Contrast:**
  - **Text on Button:** The contrast ratio between the button text and the
    button background should be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large
    text.
  - **Button to Background:** The contrast ratio between the button's background
    color and the surrounding page background should be at least 3:1.
- **Visual Cues:** Don't rely solely on color to convey information. Use
  additional visual cues like shapes, patterns, or text labels to ensure the
  button's meaning is clear to everyone, including people with color blindness.
- **Focus Indicator:** Provide a clear visual indicator when the button receives
  keyboard focus. This helps users understand which element is currently active.
  - **WCAG 2.2 has specific criteria for focus indicators:**
    - **2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (Level AA):** The focus indicator
      must not be hidden by other content on the page.
    - **2.4.13 Focus Appearance (Minimum) (Level AA):** The focus indicator must
      meet certain visibility requirements to be easily seen.

#### 2. Operable:

- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Buttons must be operable using a keyboard. Users
  should be able to navigate to the button using the Tab key and activate it
  using the Enter or Space key.  
- **Target Size:** Ensure that the button is large enough to be easily
  clickable, especially on touchscreens. WCAG recommends a minimum target size
  of 24x24 CSS pixels.
- **Dragging Movements (2.5.7 Level AA):** If a button's function relies on
  dragging, an alternative method should be provided that doesn't require
  dragging.

#### 3. Understandable:

- **Clear Labels:** The button's text label should clearly describe its
  function.
- **Consistent Design:** Use buttons consistently throughout your website. This
  helps users learn the meaning of each button and makes it easier for them to
  navigate your site.
- **Findable Help (3.2.6 Level A):** If users might need help understanding how
  to use a button or what it does, provide clear and easily findable help
  resources.

#### 4. Robust:

- **Assistive Technology Compatibility:** Ensure that buttons are compatible
  with assistive technologies like screen readers. This often involves using
  proper HTML markup and ARIA attributes to provide semantic information about
  the button.
