The Button component uses `onPress\*` props to handle all user
interactions—mouse clicks, touch taps, and keyboard presses—consistently. These
props (`onPress`, `onPressStart`, `onPressEnd`, etc.) ensure a smooth and
accessible experience regardless of the user's input method or device.

```jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button size="md" variant="solid" onPress={() => alert("clicked!")}>
    Click me... with your keyboard
  </Button>
)
```

## Accessibility Standards

### 1. Perceivable

- **Sufficient Color Contrast:**
  - **Text on Button:** The contrast ratio between the button text and the
    button background should be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large
    text.
  - **Button to Background:** The contrast ratio between the button's background
    color and the surrounding page background should be at least 3:1.
- **Visual Cues:** Don't rely solely on color to convey information. Use
  additional visual cues like shapes, patterns, or text labels to ensure the
  button's meaning is clear to everyone, including people with color blindness.
- **Focus Indicator:** Provide a clear visual indicator when the button receives
  keyboard focus. This helps users understand which element is currently active.
  - **WCAG 2.2 has specific criteria for focus indicators:**
    - **2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (Level AA):** The focus indicator
      must not be hidden by other content on the page.
    - **2.4.13 Focus Appearance (Minimum) (Level AA):** The focus indicator must
      meet certain visibility requirements to be easily seen.

### 2. Operable

- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Buttons must be operable using a keyboard. Users
  should be able to navigate to the button using the Tab key and activate it
  using the Enter or Space key.
- **Target Size:** Ensure that the button is large enough to be easily
  clickable, especially on touchscreens. WCAG recommends a minimum target size
  of 24x24 CSS pixels.
- **Dragging Movements (2.5.7 Level AA):** If a button's function relies on
  dragging, an alternative method should be provided that doesn't require
  dragging.

### 3. Understandable

- **Clear Labels:** The button's text label should clearly describe its
  function.
- **Consistent Design:** Use buttons consistently throughout your website. This
  helps users learn the meaning of each button and makes it easier for them to
  navigate your site.
- **Findable Help (3.2.6 Level A):** If users might need help understanding how
  to use a button or what it does, provide clear and easily findable help
  resources.

### 4. Robust

- **Assistive Technology Compatibility:** Ensure that buttons are compatible
  with assistive technologies like screen readers. This often involves using
  proper HTML markup and ARIA attributes to provide semantic information about
  the button.
