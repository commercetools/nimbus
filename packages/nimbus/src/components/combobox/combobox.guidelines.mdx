## Guidelines

A combobox combines a text input with a dropdown list, allowing users to type a value or select from predefined options.

### Best practices

- **Provide Instant Feedback:** Filter results in real-time as users type.
- **Handle No Results Graciously:** Display a clear message when no matching options are found.
- **Optimize for Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure full functionality using only the keyboard.
- **Consider Performance:** For very long lists, implement virtualization or lazy loading to prevent performance issues.
- **Offer Clear/Reset Option:** Provide a way for users to clear their selection if needed.
- **Match Input to Options:** If the user types a value that exactly matches an option, automatically select it.

### Usage

Users interact with a combobox by typing to filter options or by selecting from the dropdown list, expecting the component to dynamically narrow choices and allow either a selection or custom entry.

> [!TIP]\
> When to use

- Allowing custom input alongside predefined options.
- Filtering long lists.
- Providing suggestions as a user types.

> [!CAUTION]\
> When not to use

- Only predefined options are allowed.
- The list of options is very short (e.g., 2-5 options).
- Multi-selection is the primary goal without typing.
- Real-time validation of complex custom input is difficult.

### Intuitive interactions

A well-designed combobox enhances user efficiency and accuracy by offering flexible input methods with clear, dynamic feedback.

> [!CAUTION]\
> **Don't**
>
> - Use for simple dropdowns where no custom input is needed (use a select component instead).
> - Neglect to provide feedback when no options match the input.
> - Force users to type an exact match if a selection from the list is expected.
> - Rely solely on visual cues; provide ARIA attributes for screen readers.
> - Display an overwhelming number of options without filtering or pagination.
