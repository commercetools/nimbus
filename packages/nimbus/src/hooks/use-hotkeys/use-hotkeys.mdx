# useHotkeys

This hook allows you to listen to hotkeys in a declarative way and execute a
callback function once the user pressed down the given hotkey.

## Basic usage

Import the `useHotkeys` hook from the package:

```js
import { useHotkeys } from "@commercetools/nimbus";
```

## Simple Hotkey

The most basic usage for the hook is to assign a hotkey you want to listen to
and a callback to get executed once the user hits that key.

```jsx-live
import { useHotkeys } from "@commercetools/nimbus";

const App = () => {
  useHotkeys("a", () => alert("Key a was pressed"));

  return <span>Press the a key to see it work.</span>;
};
```

## Key Naming

Key names should match the standard `KeyboardEvent.code` values
(case-insensitive). For example:

- Use `"Escape"` or `"escape"` for the Escape key
- Use `"Enter"` for the Enter key
- Use `"Space"` for the Space key

For a complete list of key codes, see the
[MDN KeyboardEvent.code documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_code_values).
