# useHotkeys

This hook allows you to listen to hotkeys in a declarative way and execute a
callback function once the user pressed down the given hotkey.

## Basic Usage

Import the `useHotkeys` hook from the package:

```js
import { useHotkeys } from "@commercetools/nimbus";
```

## Simple Hotkey

The most basic usage for the hook is to assign a hotkey you want to listen to
and a callback to get executed once the user hits that key.

```jsx-live
import { useHotkeys } from "@commercetools/nimbus";

const App = () => {
  useHotkeys("a", () => alert("Key a was pressed"));

  return <span>Press the a key to see it work.</span>;
};
```
