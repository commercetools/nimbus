# Release Process

This page explains how Nimbus releases work, what to expect from each release
type, and how to stay informed about changes that may affect your application.

## Release Cadence

Nimbus follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

| Release Type      | Frequency    | Contents                           |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Major (X.0.0)** | As needed    | Breaking changes, major features   |
| **Minor (x.Y.0)** | As needed    | New features, non-breaking changes |
| **Patch (x.x.Z)** | As needed    | Bug fixes, security patches        |

We release when there's something to release. Deprecation warnings include
specific sunset dates so you can plan ahead.

## How to Stay Informed

### Communication Channels

| Channel                                                                        | What You'll Find                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [**Changelog**](https://github.com/commercetools/nimbus/releases)        | Release announcements, changelog     |
| [**GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/commercetools/nimbus/issues)            | Bug reports, feature requests        |
| [**GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/commercetools/nimbus/discussions)  | Questions, major release Q&A         |
| **#ask-nimbus-anything** (Slack)                                               | General questions                    |

### Announcement Format

All release announcements follow a consistent format:

- Version number and release type
- Summary of changes (3-5 bullet points)
- Link to full changelog
- Migration guide (if applicable)
- Thread for questions

### If Something Goes Wrong

If a release introduces a critical issue:

1. We'll create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/commercetools/nimbus/issues) documenting the problem
2. We'll publish a patch that reverts the problematic changes
3. We'll communicate in #ask-nimbus-anything linking to the issue

## Getting Support

### Self-Service Resources

Most questions can be answered through our documentation:

- **Component documentation** — Usage examples and API reference
- **Storybook** — Interactive examples and visual testing
- **Changelog** — Detailed list of all changes
- **Migration guides** — Step-by-step upgrade instructions

### Asking for Help

If you can't find what you need in the docs:

1. **Search GitHub Issues and Discussions** — Your question may have been answered before
2. **File an Issue or start a Discussion** — We aim to respond within 24 hours
3. **Internal developers**: also try #ask-nimbus-anything for quick questions

### What We Can Help With

- Clarifying documentation or API behavior
- Debugging issues with Nimbus components
- Migration guidance for breaking changes
- Feature requests and feedback

### What We Can't Help With

- Updating your application code for you
- Debugging issues in your application unrelated to Nimbus
- Guaranteeing specific timelines for feature requests (though we do consider
  urgency when planning our roadmap)

## Documentation Standards

We maintain documentation alongside code changes:

| Change Type      | Documentation Provided                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| New component    | Full docs (examples, API reference) before release  |
| New prop/feature | Updated component docs in the same release          |
| Deprecation      | Deprecation notice with timeline and migration path |
| Breaking change  | Migration guide with before/after examples          |
| Bug fix          | Changelog entry                                     |
