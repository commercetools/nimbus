# Release Process

This page explains how Nimbus releases work, what to expect from each release
type, and how to stay informed about changes that may affect your application.

## Release Cadence

Nimbus follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with a predictable
release schedule:

| Release Type      | Frequency                   | Contents                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Major (X.0.0)** | As needed (infrequently)    | Breaking changes, major features   |
| **Minor (x.Y.0)** | Monthly (1st Tuesday)       | New features, non-breaking changes |
| **Patch (x.x.Z)** | As needed                   | Bug fixes, security patches        |

### What This Means for You

- **Monthly minors** are released automatically on the 1st Tuesday of each month
  at 10:00 UTC, giving you a predictable rhythm for planning upgrades
- **Ad-hoc patches** ensure critical fixes aren't delayed by the calendar
- **Rare majors** minimize breaking change fatigue; we batch breaking changes
  when possible

> [!TIP]  
> Subscribe to release announcements to stay informed about upcoming changes.
> See [How to Stay Informed](#how-to-stay-informed) below.

## Adoption Timelines

We provide recommended timelines for adopting each release type. These are
guidelines to help you plan, not hard requirements.

| Release Type | Recommended Adoption |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| **Patch**    | Immediate to 2 weeks |
| **Minor**    | Within 60 days       |
| **Major**    | Within 90 days       |


> [!NOTE]  
> We use **soft enforcement** through deprecation warnings in the console rather
> than breaking your builds. You'll see warnings for deprecated APIs with occasional migration guidance

### Requesting an Extension

If you're unable to adopt within the recommended timeline due to resource
constraints or technical blockers, reach out to us. We're happy to discuss your
situation and provide guidance.

## How to Stay Informed

### Communication Channels

| Channel                                                                     | What You'll Find                  |

| **#nimbus-releases** (Slack)                                                | Release announcements             |
| **#ask-nimbus-anything** (Slack)                                            | General questions, bug reports    |
| **Changelog** ([GitHub](https://github.com/commercetools/nimbus/releases))  | Detailed technical changes        |

### Announcement Format

All release announcements follow a consistent format:

- Version number and release type
- Summary of changes (3-5 bullet points)
- Link to full changelog
- Migration guide (if applicable)
- Thread for questions

### If Something Goes Wrong

If a release introduces a critical issue:

1. We'll communicate immediately in #nimbus-releases
2. We'll publish a patch that reverts the problematic changes
3. We'll provide a timeline for the proper fix

## Getting Support

### Self-Service Resources

Most questions can be answered through our documentation:

- **Component documentation** — Usage examples and API reference (pinned in #ask-nimbus-anything)
- **Storybook** — Interactive examples and visual testing
- **Changelog** — Detailed list of all changes
- **Migration guides** — Step-by-step upgrade instructions

### Asking for Help

If you can't find what you need in the docs:

1. **Search #ask-nimbus-anything** — Your question may have been answered before
2. **Post in #ask-nimbus-anything** — We aim to respond within 24 hours
3. **File a GitHub issue** — For confirmed bugs or feature requests

### Office Hours

For major releases, we hold office hours where you can get live help with
migrations and ask questions directly. These are announced in #nimbus-releases.

### What We Can Help With

- Clarifying documentation or API behavior
- Debugging issues with Nimbus components
- Migration guidance for breaking changes
- Feature requests and feedback

### What We Can't Help With

- Updating your application code for you
- Debugging issues in your application unrelated to Nimbus
- Expedited timelines for specific features
