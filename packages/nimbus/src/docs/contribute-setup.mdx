## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v22.14.0+
- **PNPM**: v9.12.3+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/commercetools/nimbus.git
```

2. Enter the repository directory:

```bash
cd nimbus
```

3. Initialize the project:

```bash
pnpm nimbus:init
```

## Development

### Starting the Development Environment

Start the development environment with the following command:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will start both the documentation app and Storybook in parallel:

- Documentation app: http://localhost:5173/
- Storybook: http://localhost:6006/

If you prefer to run just one of the applications:

```bash
# Start only the documentation app
pnpm start:docs

# Start only Storybook
pnpm start:storybook
```

### Building the Project

#### Complete Build

Build all packages and applications:

```bash
pnpm build
```

#### Targeted Builds

Build only specific parts of the system:

```bash
# Build only the packages (not the docs application)
pnpm build:packages

# Build only the documentation application
pnpm build:docs

# Build only the design tokens
pnpm build:tokens
```
