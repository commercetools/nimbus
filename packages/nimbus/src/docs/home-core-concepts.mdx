# Core concepts

This page is designed to help you understand the foundational concepts so that
you can get quickly started with using the Nimbus Design System in your
projects.

Nimbus aims to provide a comprehensive suite of accessible and pre-themed React components, enabling developers to build beautiful and consistent user interfaces with ease. However, it's important to understand the following underlying concepts to make the most of the system.

## Technical foundation

- Nimbus is a [`react`](https://react.dev/) component library built to provide a
  consistent and accessible design system.
- Under the hood, it leverages the power of CSS-in-JS through
  [`@emotion/react`](https://emotion.sh/)
- For its styling and theming capabilities, Nimbus utilizes
  [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
- For all components that are requiring user-interaction Nimbus is making use of
  suitable [`react-aria`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/)
  components or hooks to guarantee enterprise-grade accessibility.

## Core Concepts

To effectively use the Nimbus Design System, it's helpful to understand the
following core concepts:

### 1. NimbusProvider

At the root of your application, you'll need to include the `NimbusProvider`.
This component is essential as it provides the theme (colors, spacing,
typography, etc.) and other context necessary for all Nimbus components to
function correctly.

```tsx
import { NimbusProvider } from "@commercetools/nimbus";
import { YourApp } from "./you-app";

function App() {
  return (
    <NimbusProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </NimbusProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### 2. Component Types

Nimbus offers a rich library of pre-built UI components that you can use to
construct your application's interface. These components are designed to be
accessible, customizable, and consistent with the Nimbus design language.

We differentiate between two types of components:

#### Primitive Components

These are fundamental building blocks, often representing a single HTML element
or a very simple UI concept. They are designed to be used on their own or
composed to create more complex UIs.

Examples: `Button`, `Box`, `Flex`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Icon`.

```tsx
import { Stack, Heading, Text, Button } from "@commercetools/nimbus";

function MyPrimitiveExample() {
  return (
    <Stack>
      <Heading>This is a heading</Heading>
      <Text>This is a paragraph of text.</Text>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

#### Compound Components

These components are more complex and are typically made up of several distinct
parts that work together to provide a piece of functionality. They often manage
internal state or have a specific structure.

Examples: `Alert`, `Card`, `Grid`, `Select`, `Accordion`, `Table`.

When using compound components, you'll import multiple related components at
once. For instance, with `Select`, you might use `Select.Root`,
`Select.Options`, `Select.Option`, etc.

```tsx
import { Select } from "@commercetools/nimbus"; // Assuming Select is a top-level import

function MySelectExample() {
  return (
    <Select.Root placeholder="Select a fruit">
      <Select.Options>
        <Select.Option>Apples</Select.Option>
        <Select.Option>Bananas</Select.Option>
        <Select.Option>Oranges</Select.Option>
        <Select.Option>Cherries</Select.Option>
      </Select.Options>
    </Select.Root>
  );
}
```

### 3. Design Tokens

At the heart of Nimbus's theming capabilities are **Design Tokens**. These are
named entities that store indivisible pieces of the visual design, such as
specific colors, spacing units, font sizes, border radii, etc. Instead of
hardcoding a hex value like `#007bff` or a pixel value like `16px`, you simply
use a token.

Design tokens are organized by their **purpose** and map to one or more
style-props.

- **Color Tokens**: For any property that accepts a color value, like
  `backgroundColor`, `color`, `borderColor`.
- **Spacing Tokens**: Exclusively for properties that define space, such as
  `padding`, `margin`, `gap`, `top`, `left`, etc.
- **Size Tokens** : Used for `width`, `height`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`,
  `minHeight`, `maxHeight`.
- **Typography Tokens**: For text-related style props like `fontSize`,
  `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`.
- etc.

All Nimbus components are fundamentally built using these design tokens.

### 4. Style Props

For direct and granular CSS control, many Nimbus components expose **Style
Props**. These props are typically named after their corresponding CSS
properties (e.g., `backgroundColor`, `padding`, `margin`, `width`, `display`,
`alignItems`).

The key advantage of using Nimbus Style Props over inline `style` attributes is
their direct integration with the **Design Token** system (see the
[Design Tokens](#3-design-tokens) section). You should primarily use Design
Tokens as values for these props. This ensures that even fine-grained
adjustments remain consistent with the overall design system and are easily
maintainable.

Style props are excellent for:

- Making specific layout adjustments
- Applying a specific color from the token palette directly (e.g.,
  `color="primary.11"`).
- Overriding a particular aspect of a component's appearance when a more general
  theming prop (like `variant` or `colorPalette`) doesn't cover the specific need, or
  when a highly localized, one-off style is required.

```tsx
import { Box, Text } from "@commercetools/nimbus";

function CustomTextInBox() {
  return (
    <Box
      padding="400" // Design token for padding, comming from the spacing tokens
      backgroundColor="primary.2" // Design token for color, comming from the color tokens
      border="solid-25" // Token for borders
      borderRadius="full" // Design token for radii
    >
      <Text color="primary.11" fontSize="1200" fontWeight="500">
        This box uses Style Props with Design Tokens for custom styling.
      </Text>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

While Style Props offer great flexibility, it's generally recommended to use
standard theming props (discussed in the
[Theming and Styling](#6-theming-and-styling) section) for common styling
scenarios. Reserve Style Props for situations requiring specific, low-level
control, always pairing them with Design Tokens to maintain consistency.

### 5. Polymorphism

Many Nimbus components, particularly Primitive Components, support polymorphism.
This powerful feature allows you to change the underlying HTML element a
component renders to the DOM while retaining its established styling and
behavior. This is primarily achieved through the `as` or `asChild` props.

- The `as` prop directly changes the rendered HTML tag. For example, a `Text`
  component, which might render a `<span>` by default, can be changed to render
  a `<p>` or an `<em>` tag:

  ```tsx
  import { Text } from "@commercetools/nimbus";

  <Text as="p">This text will be rendered as a paragraph.</Text>
  <Text as="span">This text will be rendered as a span.</Text>
  ```

- The `asChild` prop offers a more advanced way to handle polymorphism. It
  allows a Nimbus component to delegate its rendering to a single child
  component. When `asChild` is true, the Nimbus component itself doesn't render
  a DOM element; instead, it clones its child and merges its own props (like
  styles and event handlers) onto the child. This is incredibly useful for
  applying Nimbus styling and behavior to an existing component (e.g., a `Link`
  from a routing library) without altering the child's core functionality or
  prop structure. It ensures that the child retains its own capabilities while
  seamlessly integrating the parent's visual attributes.

  ```tsx
  import { Button } from "@commercetools/nimbus";
  import { Link } from "your-router-library"; // Fictional router Link

  <Button variant="solid" colorPalette="primary" asChild>
    <Link to="/some-page">Navigate</Link>
  </Button>;

  // = the Button's styles and behaviors are applied to the Link
  ```

  While most common in Primitive Components, some Compound Components might also
  offer polymorphic capabilities where appropriate.

### 6. Theming

Nimbus components derive their appearance from the underlying
[Design Tokens](#3-design-tokens). Beyond direct styling with
[Style Props](#4-style-props), components offer dedicated **theming props** to
apply common, pre-defined visual treatments.

These theming props are the primary way to align components with the established
Nimbus design language and ensure a consistent look and feel. They encapsulate
sets of styles related to a component's variants, sizes, or semantic `colorPalette`s.

Common theming props include:

- `variant`: Often dictates the overall style of a component (e.g., `solid`,
  `outline`, `ghost`).
- `size`: Controls the dimensions of the component (e.g., `sm`, `md`, `lg`).
- `textStyle`: Specifically for text-based components like `Text` or `Heading`,
  this prop applies a predefined typographic style (which includes font size,
  weight, line height, etc.) like `body`, `caption`, `h1`, etc.
- `colorPalette`: This prop is used to apply a specific color scheme to a
  component when the color isn't necessarily tied to a semantic meaning (like
  `success` or `warning`). Instead, it offers a way to achieve visual variation
  or categorization. For example, a `Badge` component might use `colorPalette`
  to offer various background and text color combinations (e.g., "blue",
  "green", "purple", "orange") for purely aesthetic purposes or to group items
  by a non-semantic color.

```tsx
import { Button, Text, Card, Badge } from "@commercetools/nimbus";

function ThemedComponents() {
  return (
    <>
      <Text textStyle="caption">I look like a caption</Text>
      <Button variant="solid" colorPalette="primary" size="lg">
        Large Primary Button
      </Button>
      <Button variant="outline" colorPalette="critical" size="xs">
        xSmall Critical Outline
      </Button>
      <Badge colorPalette="blue">Blue Badge</Badge>
      <Badge colorPalette="purple">Purple Badge</Badge>
    </>
  );
}
```

### 7. Responsive Styling

Nimbus components are designed to be responsive, allowing you to adapt their
styles for different screen sizes. This is typically achieved by providing an an
object to [Style Props](#4-style-props) or some theming props.

The [breakpoints](/tokens/other/breakpoints) (e.g., `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`,
`2xl`) used for responsive styling are defined within the theme provided by
`NimbusProvider`.

The `base` key is the default value that applies if no screen size matches.

```tsx
import { Stack, Text } from "@commercetools/nimbus";

function ResponsiveStack() {
  return (
    <Stack
      direction={{ base: "column", md: "row" }} // Column on mobile, row on medium screens and up
      padding={{ base: "400", lg: "600" }} // Different padding for small vs large screens
      gap="400"
    >
      <Text>Item 1</Text>
      <Text>Item 2</Text>
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

This approach allows for intuitive and declarative responsive design directly
within your component's props.

### 8. Using Icons

The `@nimbus/icons` package provides a large set of icons optimized for use with
Nimbus components. These icons can be easily integrated to enhance the visual
communication of your interface. They will adapt to the context they are used in
by default and allow for easy customization when used in combination with the
Icon component.

To use an icon, import it from `@commercetools/nimbus-icons` and use it like any
other React component.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@commercetools/nimbus";
import { IconCheckCircle } from "@commercetools/nimbus-icons";

function ComponentsWithIcons() {
  return (
    <Button variant="solid" colorPalette="primary">
      <IconCheckCircle /> Submit
    </Button>
  );
}
```

For more granular control over icon appearance, you can use the `Icon` component 
from Nimbus to customize properties such as size, color, and other style 
attributes. This component wraps the imported icons and allows them to be styled 
consistently with the design system's tokens.

```tsx
import { Icon, Box } from "@commercetools/nimbus";
import { IconEdit, IconDelete } from "@commercetools/nimbus-icons";

function CustomizedIcons() {
  return (
    <Box display="flex" gap="400">
      {/* Customize icon size */}
      <Icon as={IconEdit} boxSize="800" />
      
      {/* Customize icon color */}
      <Icon as={IconDelete} color="critical.9" />
      
      {/* Apply multiple style properties */}
      <Icon
        as={IconEdit}
        boxSize="1000"
        color="primary.11"
        opacity="0.8"
        transition="all 0.2s"
        _hover={{ opacity: "1", transform: "scale(1.1)" }}
      />
    </Box>
  );
}
```
