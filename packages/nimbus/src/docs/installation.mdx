## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v22.14.0+
- **PNPM**: v9.12.3+

### Installation

All commands should be run from the repository root.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/commercetools/nimbus.git
   cd nimbus
   ```

2. Initialize the repository:

   ```bash
   pnpm nimbus:init
   ```

> [!TIP]  
> It is advisable to run the `nimbus:init` command after every branch-switch.
> The command gets rid of all `node_modules`- & `dist`-folders, reinstalls
> dependencies and rebuilds all packages.

## Development Workflow

### Development Mode

Start the development environment with the following command:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will start both the documentation app and Storybook in parallel:

- Documentation app: http://localhost:5173/
- Storybook: http://localhost:6006/

If you prefer to run just one of the applications:

```bash
# Start only the documentation app
pnpm start:docs

# Start only Storybook
pnpm start:storybook
```

### Building the Project

#### Complete Build

Build all packages and applications:

```bash
pnpm build
```

#### Targeted Builds

Build only specific parts of the system:

```bash
# Build only the packages (not the docs application)
pnpm build:packages

# Build only the documentation application
pnpm build:docs

# Build only the design tokens
pnpm build:tokens
```
