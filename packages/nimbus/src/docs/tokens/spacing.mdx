# Spacing Tokens

Spacing tokens are used to define the space between elements. They are used to
create consistent spacing between elements and to ensure that the layout is
visually balanced.

> [!NOTE]  
> Every token has a negative equivalent, in case you need to apply a negative
> margin etc. Access the negative version by prependind the token name with a
> dash. e.g. `-100`, `-400`, `-1000`, etc.

> [!TIP]  
> To quickly calculate the token value in px, take the token name and divide it
> by 25. e.g. `100 / 25 = 4px`, `400 / 25 = 16px`, `1000 / 25 = 40px`, etc.
