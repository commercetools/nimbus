# Animations

This page provides a list of tokens for applying ready made animations
(shorthands) or creating custom animations or transitions by combining keyframe
animations with durations and easings.

## Shorthands

The following list of shorthand tokens can be used as `animation` property
value, they combine a keyframe animation with duration and easing for a reusable
animation definition.

## Keyframe Animations

CSS keyframe animations define animations as a sequence of steps, each with its
own set of properties. They allow for more complex, multi-step animations that
can be controlled with keyframes and timing functions.

## Durations

Durations define **how long** an animation takes to complete one cycle, directly
impacting the perception of speed and fluidity.

Short durations create snappy, quick interactions that feel responsive but can
risk appearing abrupt. Longer durations allow for smoother, more deliberate
motion but can feel sluggish if overused.

Finding the right balance is key—durations should match the context and intent
of the interaction. They’re measured in seconds or milliseconds and are often
paired with easings to create harmonious, intentional animations.

## Easings

_Easings_ determine **the rate of change** of an animation over time,
essentially defining how an animation transitions between its start and end
states.

Instead of moving linearly, animations can accelerate, decelerate, or follow
complex curves, making the motion feel more dynamic and natural.

This is achieved through mathematical easing functions, like linear
interpolation or bezier curves, which map progress over time to the visible
change in animation properties. It controls the "rhythm" of the animation,
ensuring it feels fluid or deliberate depending on the desired effect.
