# Breakpoints

Breakpoints define specific screen widths at which your design should adapt to
provide an optimal viewing experience for users. They are thresholds that
represent a starting point for changes in styling, such as font sizes, layouts,
and visibility of elements.

Each breakpoint is a minimum width, meaning that styles associated with that
breakpoint apply to screen sizes equal to or larger than the specified width.
The styles remain active until the next breakpoint threshold is reached.

## Tokens

The breakpoints **start** at the specified value and **end** at the next
breakpoint value. The following breakpoint-tokens are supported:
