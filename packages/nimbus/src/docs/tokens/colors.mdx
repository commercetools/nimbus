# Colors

In our design system, colors are organized into **scales** based on **contrast**
levels to ensure clarity and **usability** across various contexts. Each scale
provides a range of tones, from subtle backgrounds to high-contrast elements
like text and interactive borders, enabling a consistent and accessible user
experience.

The scales are _interchangeable_, meaning a color like red can be swapped with
green without losing the intended contrast levels. This flexibility ensures that
our designs remain adaptable while maintaining visual hierarchy. Additionally,
_the contrast-based approach eliminates the need for a separate "dark mode"
design_, as the scales naturally support both light and dark environments
seamlessly.

## Scale steps

Below is a list of steps with corresponding use cases for various background,
border, and text styles in the design system:

| **Step** | **Use Case** | **WCAG AA Text Pairing** |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1        | App background                                         | Steps 11, 12            |
| 2        | Subtle background                                      | Steps 11, 12            |
| 3        | UI element background                                  | Steps 11, 12            |
| 4        | Hovered UI element background                          | Steps 11, 12            |
| 5        | Active / Selected UI element background                | Steps 11, 12            |
| 6        | Subtle borders and separators                          | —                        |
| 7        | UI element border and focus rings                      | —                        |
| 8        | Hovered UI element border                              | —                        |
| 9        | Solid backgrounds                                      | contrast step            |
| 10       | Hovered solid backgrounds                              | contrast step            |
| 11       | Low-contrast text                                      | Steps 1–5               |
| 12       | High-contrast text                                     | Steps 1–5               |
| contrast | High-contrast text on solid backgrounds                | Steps 9, 10             |

The Radix color system guarantees that background steps (1–5) always meet
WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1) with text steps (11–12) across all color scales.
This is why the scales are interchangeable — swapping one color scale for
another preserves the same contrast relationships. For solid background colors
(steps 9–10), use the special `contrast` step which provides a black or white
value guaranteed to meet contrast requirements.

For more details on how the scale is designed, see the
[Radix color scale documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/understanding-the-scale).

## System Colors

Colors available for decoration or reference.

<br />

<ColorScales ids="tomato,red,ruby, crimson, pink, plum, purple, violet, iris,indigo,blue,cyan, teal,jade,green,grass,bronze,gold,brown,orange,amber,yellow,lime,mint,sky" />

## Blacks & Whites

Black and white color scales do not adapt to the selected color-mode. Means a
white will always be white, a black will always be black.

> [!TIP]  
> Use the `neutral` color scales if you want to refer to a gray-tone that works
> on the current background color (light-/dark-mode dependent).

<br />

<ColorScales ids="blackAlpha, whiteAlpha" />

## Brand Colors

Custom colors, tailored to the brand.

<br />

<ColorScales ids="ctviolet, ctteal, ctyellow" />

## Semantic Colors
