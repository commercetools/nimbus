# Colors

Our color system is built on [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors),
which organizes colors into **scales** based on **contrast** levels to ensure
clarity and **usability** across various contexts. Each scale provides a range
of tones, from subtle backgrounds to high-contrast elements like text and
interactive borders. A full scale for a given color is referred to as a
**colorPalette** (e.g., colorPalette: "red").

The scales are _interchangeable_, meaning a color like red can be swapped with
green without losing the intended contrast levels. This flexibility ensures that
our designs remain adaptable while maintaining visual hierarchy. Additionally,
_the contrast-based approach eliminates the need for a separate "dark mode"
design_, as the scales naturally support both light and dark environments
seamlessly.

## Scale steps

Below is a list of steps with corresponding use cases for various background,
border, and text styles in the design system:

| **Step** | **Use Case** | **WCAG AA Text Pairing** |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **1**        | App background                                         | Steps 11, 12            |
| **2**        | Subtle background                                      | Steps 11, 12            |
| **3**        | UI element background                                  | Steps 11, 12            |
| **4**        | Hovered UI element background                          | Steps 11, 12            |
| **5**        | Active / Selected UI element background                | Steps 11, 12            |
| **6**        | Subtle borders and separators                          | —                        |
| **7**        | UI element border and focus rings                      | —                        |
| **8**        | Hovered UI element border                              | —                        |
| **9**        | Solid backgrounds                                      | contrast step            |
| **10**       | Hovered solid backgrounds                              | contrast step            |
| **11**       | Low-contrast text                                      | Steps 1–5               |
| **12**       | High-contrast text                                     | Steps 1–5               |
| **contrast** | High-contrast text on solid backgrounds                | Steps 9, 10             |

<br />

Background steps (1–5) are designed to pair with text steps (11–12) across all
color scales, and the scales are interchangeable — swapping one color scale for
another preserves the same contrast relationships. For solid background colors
(steps 9–10), use the special `contrast` step which provides a black or white
value optimized for readability.

The Radix color system is designed to produce accessible palettes. Radix uses
[APCA (Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm)](https://github.com/Myndex/APCA),
a more advanced method for calculating perceived contrast that accounts for
human visual perception more accurately than the traditional WCAG 2.x formula.

> **Note:** Some automated accessibility tools still use the older WCAG 2.x
> synthetic contrast calculation (4.5:1 ratio), which can produce false
> positives for certain color combinations that APCA considers accessible. If
> your tooling flags contrast issues with these pairings, verify the results
> against an APCA-based checker before making changes.

For more details on how the scale is designed, see the
[Radix color scale documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/understanding-the-scale).

## Semantic Colors

Colors with meaning, used to communicate status or state.

<br />

<ColorScales ids="primary, neutral, info, positive, warning, critical" />

## Brand Colors

Custom colors, tailored to the brand.

<br />

<ColorScales ids="ctviolet, ctteal, ctyellow" />

## System Colors

Colors available for decoration or reference.

<br />

<ColorScales ids="tomato,red,ruby, crimson, pink, plum, purple, violet, iris,indigo,blue,cyan, teal,jade,green,grass,bronze,gold,brown,orange,amber,yellow,lime,mint,sky" />

## Blacks & Whites

Black and white color scales do not adapt to the selected color-mode. Means a
white will always be white, a black will always be black.

> [!TIP]
> Use the `neutral` color scales if you want to refer to a gray-tone that works
> on the current background color (light-/dark-mode dependent).

<br />

<ColorScales ids="blackAlpha, whiteAlpha" />
