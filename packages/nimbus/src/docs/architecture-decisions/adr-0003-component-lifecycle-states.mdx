# ADR: Nimbus Software Lifecycle States

## Context

As Nimbus grows and evolves, we need a clear system to communicate the
stability, support level, and future trajectory of our components, hooks,
utilities, functions, and classes to consumers. Without a standardized
lifecycle system, consumers cannot make informed decisions about adoption,
migration planning, or production readiness.

The lack of clear lifecycle states leads to:
- Uncertainty about which features are safe for production use
- Difficulty planning migrations when APIs change
- Inconsistent expectations about support and maintenance
- Confusion about the maturity level of different library elements

We need a structured approach that balances innovation (allowing for
experimentation and iteration) with stability (providing reliable,
production-ready features).

## Decision

We will implement a six-stage lifecycle system for all UI library elements,
divided into Pre-Release States and General Availability States. Each state
clearly communicates stability expectations, support commitments, and
transition pathways.

### Pre-Release States

These states are for features under active development, subject to rapid
change, and not yet recommended for general production use.

#### 1. Experimental
- **Purpose**: Earliest public state for new concepts, significant API
  redesigns, or exploratory features
- **Stability**: Highly unstable, may be removed entirely without notice
- **Goal**: Validate ideas and gather initial conceptual feedback
- **Consumer Usage**: Absolutely not for production use; only for deep
  exploration and early-stage feedback
- **Breaking Changes**: Highest frequency, no advance warning
- **Transitions**: To Alpha (if viable) or Deprecated (if not viable)
- **Marking**: Clearly marked as `(Experimental)` in documentation,
  changelogs, and `@experimental` JSDoc tag

#### 2. Alpha
- **Purpose**: Features with clearer direction that have passed experimental
  validation
- **Stability**: Still highly unstable with known bugs and incomplete
  functionality
- **Goal**: Early adopter testing and initial feedback on core concepts
- **Consumer Usage**: Not for production use; exploration and feedback only
- **Breaking Changes**: Frequent breaking changes without warning
- **Transitions**: To Beta (if successful) or Deprecated (if not viable)
- **Marking**: Clearly marked as `(Alpha)` in documentation, changelogs, and
  `@alpha` JSDoc tag

#### 3. Beta
- **Purpose**: More stable features with mostly complete core functionality
- **Stability**: Subject to breaking changes but less frequently than Alpha
- **Goal**: Gather broad feedback on functionality and usability
- **Consumer Usage**: Use with caution in non-critical production
  environments
- **Breaking Changes**: Some breaking changes, typically with prior notice,
  may occur in minor versions
- **Transitions**: To Stable (if successful) or Deprecated (if not viable)
- **Marking**: Clearly marked as `(Beta)` in documentation, changelogs, and
  `@beta` JSDoc tag

### General Availability States

These states represent stable and supported features, and features being
phased out.

#### 4. Stable
- **Purpose**: Standard, production-ready state
- **Stability**: API considered stable, thoroughly tested, and actively
  maintained
- **Goal**: Provide reliable, consistent functionality for production
  applications
- **Consumer Usage**: Recommended for all production applications
- **Breaking Changes**: Adhere to strict semantic versioning (only in major
  releases) with clear migration guides
- **Transitions**: To Deprecated (when superseded or no longer relevant)
- **Marking**: Default status requiring no special marking; documentation
  confirms stability

#### 5. Deprecated
- **Purpose**: Not to be used in new development. Superseded by better
  alternatives or found not viable as an Alpha or Beta
- **Stability**: Maintained for compatibility but no new features
- **Goal**: Provide transition period for migration to alternatives
- **Consumer Usage**: Avoid for new development; migrate existing usage to
  recommended alternatives
- **Breaking Changes**: Only critical bug fixes; no new features
- **Transitions**: To End-of-Life (EOL)
- **Marking**: Clear warnings in documentation with recommended alternatives;
  `@deprecated` JSDoc tag; console warnings during development; date for 
  the EOL transition

#### 6. End-of-Life (EOL)
- **Purpose**: Complete removal from the library
- **Stability**: No longer available
- **Goal**: Clean up deprecated features
- **Consumer Usage**: Element is gone; applications using it will break upon
  upgrade
- **Breaking Changes**: N/A (element removed)
- **Transitions**: N/A (terminal state)
- **Marking**: Not present in current documentation or code; removal noted in
  release notes

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Clear Communication**: Consumers can make informed decisions about
  feature adoption based on explicit stability guarantees
- **Predictable Migration Path**: Well-defined transition states help
  consumers plan upgrades and migrations
- **Innovation Support**: Pre-release states allow for experimentation while
  protecting production users
- **Maintenance Clarity**: Clear support commitments for each state help
  prioritize development resources
- **Semantic Versioning Alignment**: Lifecycle states work with semantic
  versioning to provide comprehensive change communication

### Negative Consequences

- **Additional Overhead**: Requires consistent marking and tracking of
  lifecycle states across all library elements
- **Documentation Complexity**: More detailed documentation needed to explain
  states and transitions
- **Consumer Learning Curve**: Users must understand the lifecycle system to
  make appropriate adoption decisions
- **Potential Confusion**: Multiple pre-release states might create
  uncertainty about which features to try

### Implementation Requirements

- **Documentation Standards**: All elements must be clearly marked with their
  lifecycle state
- **Tooling Integration**: JSDoc tags, TypeScript definitions, and build
  tools should reflect lifecycle states
- **Communication Process**: Clear guidelines for announcing state
  transitions in changelogs and release notes
- **Development Workflow**: Integration with development processes to ensure
  proper state management

## Examples

### Experimental Feature
```jsx
/**
 * @experimental This component is experimental and may be removed without
 * notice
 */
export const ExperimentalDataGrid = () => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Beta Feature with Migration Path
```jsx
/**
 * @beta This component is in beta. API may change in minor versions.
 * Expected to reach stable in v2.1.0
 */
export const BetaAdvancedSelect = () => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Deprecated Feature
```jsx
/**
 * @deprecated Use `NewButton` instead. Will be removed in v3.0.0
 * @see {@link NewButton}
 */
export const OldButton = () => {
  console.warn('OldButton is deprecated. Use NewButton instead.');
  // Implementation
};
```

## Summary

The six-stage lifecycle system provides clear communication about feature
stability and support commitments. Pre-release states (Experimental, Alpha,
Beta) enable innovation while protecting production users, while General
Availability states (Stable, Deprecated, EOL) ensure reliable long-term
support and predictable migration paths.

This system balances the need for innovation with stability requirements,
giving consumers the information they need to make appropriate adoption
decisions while providing clear guidelines for library maintainers.
