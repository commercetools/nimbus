# Installation

How to add Nimbus to your react frontend.

## 1. Install the nimbus packages

You can install Nimbus using your preferred package manager.

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add @commercetools/nimbus @commercetools/nimbus-icons
```

### npm

```bash
npm install @commercetools/nimbus @commercetools/nimbus-icons
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add @commercetools/nimbus @commercetools/nimbus-icons
```

## 2. Set up NimbusProvider

Wrap your application with the `NimbusProvider` at the root level. This provider
is essential for Nimbus components to function correctly, as it supplies the
necessary theme and context.

```tsx
// App.tsx or main.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { NimbusProvider } from "@commercetools/nimbus";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NimbusProvider>
      <App />
    </NimbusProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

## 3. Use Nimbus Components

Once the provider is set up, you can start using Nimbus components in your
application.

```jsx
// App.tsx
import { Flex, Box, Button } from "@commercetools/nimbus";
import { ArrowForward } from "@commercetools/nimbus-icons";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Flex width="100vw" height="100vh">
      <Box margin="auto">
        <Button
          variant="solid"
          tone="primary"
          onPress={() => alert("It just works!")}
        >
          <ArrowForward /> Click me
        </Button>
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  );
};

export default App;
```

That's it! You've successfully installed and set up Nimbus in your project. You
can now explore and use the wide range of components offered by the library.

## Next steps

Before diving into actual implementation work with Nimbus, take some time to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals.
Once you have a solid grasp of these concepts, you'll be well-prepared to explore the individual component documentation and start building beautiful, accessible interfaces with Nimbus.
