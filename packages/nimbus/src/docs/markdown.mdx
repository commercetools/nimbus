# Markdown / MDX Stress Test

This is a page to stress test markdown & mdx syntax usages to see if everything
renders without issues.

## Basic Markdown

Basic markdown is supported.

### Headings

See the bold Text above? This is a heading. Not gonna demonstrate them, they are
used everwhere on a page, but this is what you'd use in markdown or mdx files to
write one:

```markdown
# H1 Most important

## H2 Heading

### H3 Heading

#### H4 Heading

##### H5 Heading

###### H6 Least important
```

### Emphasizing Text

#### Italic Text

_Italic text_ is done with underscores `_String to highlight_`

#### Bold Text

**Bold text** is done with double asterisks `**String to highlight**`

#### Bold + Italic Text

**_Bold + Italic text_** is done with tripple asterisks
`***String to highlight***`

### Code

Code can be displayed inline or in a code-block, use single backticks for
inline-code or tripple backticks for code blocks.

Look at this: `export const App = () => <div>App</div>` this was inline code.

And here is a code-block:

```jsx
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>App</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Blockquote

This is how a regular blockquote looks. There are more variants of blockquotes
but they are belonging to the Github flavored Markdown though.

> Sugar plum shortbread dragée chocolate bar lollipop. Bonbon soufflé cupcake
> cotton candy bear claw muffin tiramisu

### Links

Link look pretty basic [tiramisu croissant gummies](http://www.asdasdsd.com)

### Images

Images work as well.

```markdown

```
