# Fields

Field pattern components provide a consistent way to integrate input components within FormField wrappers. These patterns simplify form building by combining labels, descriptions, validation, and error handling into a single, opinionated API.

## When to use field patterns

Field patterns are ideal for:
- Building standard forms with consistent field layouts
- Reducing boilerplate in form code
- Ensuring accessibility best practices across all form fields
- Integrating with form libraries like Formik
