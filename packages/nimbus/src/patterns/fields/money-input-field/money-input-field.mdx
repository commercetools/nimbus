## Overview

MoneyInputField is a pattern component that combines the FormField wrapper with the MoneyInput component. This integration provides a complete form field experience including accessible labels, helper text descriptions, info popovers for supplementary information, and comprehensive validation and error handling, all through a simplified, opinionated API.

The component contains two focusable inputs: a currency selector and an amount input field, providing an intuitive interface for monetary value entry with automatic formatting based on the selected currency.
