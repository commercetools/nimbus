## Overview

SearchInputField is a pattern component that combines the FormField wrapper with the SearchInput component. This integration provides a complete form field experience including accessible labels, helper text descriptions, info popovers for supplementary information, and comprehensive validation and error handling, all through a simplified, opinionated API.

The component features a built-in search icon, clear button that appears when text is entered, keyboard shortcuts (Escape to clear, Enter to submit), and supports various visual variants and sizes.
