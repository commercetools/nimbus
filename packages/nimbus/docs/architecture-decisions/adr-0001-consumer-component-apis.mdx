# ADR: On Consumer Component API's

## Context

We needed an Alert component to show informational or warning messages. The
component should allow:

- A title and description.
- An optional dismiss button.
- Additional buttons or controls.
- Spacing/styling overrides (e.g. px, py).

In early explorations, we tried to expose everything via props on the main
`Alert`—this seemed convenient but would quickly became unwieldy when
requirements changed. This led to a discussion about how to structure the API
for components in a way that is both flexible and maintainable.

## Early Attempts

### Attempt A: One Big Alert with Child Buttons

```jsx
<Alert
  title="title"
  description="description"
  onDismiss={() => void}
  px="4"
  py="2"
>
  <button>Dismiss</button>
  <button>Click me</button>
</Alert>
```

1. title and description are top-level props.
2. children are the alert's buttons.

**Issue**: If we need new kinds of controls (e.g., a link, extra text, or
re-positioned buttons), we must keep adding or repurposing props. The line
between "belongs in children" vs. "belongs in dedicated props" can become
blurry.

### Attempt B: Specialized Props for Each Slot

```jsx
<Alert
  alertTitleStyle="bold"
  title="title"
  description="description"
  onDismiss={() => void}
  px="4"
  py="2"
  alertControls={
    <>
      <button>Dismiss</button>
      <button>Click me</button>
    </>
  }
/>
```

1. We introduced an alertControls prop for the buttons.
2. We also added alertTitleStyle to control how the title looks.

**Issue**: As the design evolves (e.g., "Now we need the title right‐aligned, or
a sub‐title below the main title"), we keep adding ad-hoc props like
titlePosition, alertControlsAlignment, etc. The `<Alert>` props list grows large
and messy.

### Attempt C: Even More Props for Layout / Positioning

```jsx
<Alert
  alertTitleStyle="bold"
  title="title"
  titlePosition="right"
  description="description"
  onDismiss={() => void}
  px="4"
  py="2"
  alertControls={
    <>
      <button>Dismiss</button>
      <button>Click me</button>
    </>
  }
/>
```

**Issue**: The top-level `<Alert>` component now has numerous styling, layout,
and content props all jumbled together. If a new design wants a second dismiss
button or a multi-line description, we must add more props. This is non-scalable
and not very semantic.

## Final Decision: Compound Components

We decided to adopt compound components (a pattern in which sub-elements are
also React components). The final API looks like:

```jsx
<Alert px="4" py="2">
  <Alert.Title fontStyle="bold">
    Alert Title
  </Alert.Title>
  <Alert.Description>
    A short alert description.
  </Alert.Description>
  <Alert.DismissButton onClick={() => void} />
</Alert>
```

### Key Changes:

1. Children become semantic slots: `<Alert.Title>`, `<Alert.Description>`, and
   `<Alert.DismissButton>`.
2. Each slot can handle its own styling or props. For instance, Alert.Title
   might accept a fontStyle prop, Alert.DismissButton handles its own click
   event.
3. The root `<Alert>` only handles general layout or high-level variant props
   (e.g., px, py, severity).

### Why this is better:

- **Clear separation of concerns**: Layout/styling for each slot belongs to that
  slot. The main `<Alert>` only handles spacing or theming.
- **Easier to extend**: If we need a second sub-element (e.g., `<Alert.Icon>` or
  `<Alert.Footer>`), we just introduce a new subcomponent. We don't clog
  `<Alert>` with more props.
- **Semantic**: `<Alert.Title>` and `<Alert.Description>` are more descriptive
  than `title="..."` or `alertControls={...}`.

## Consequences

- We have a more verbose but much more flexible API.
- Consumers build their alert in a semantic, composable way.
- We can add or rearrange subcomponents without rewriting the main `<Alert>`
  props or code.
- If developers want quick usage (like a single short message), they might find
  passing a couple props simpler – but we've prioritized long-term
  maintainability and clarity.

## Examples in Practice

### 1. Basic Alert

```jsx
<Alert>
  <Alert.Title>Warning!</Alert.Title>
  <Alert.Description>Please fill out all required fields.</Alert.Description>
  <Alert.DismissButton onClick={onClose} />
</Alert>
```

### 2. Alert with Extra Controls

```jsx
<Alert px="4" py="3">
  <Alert.Title fontStyle="bold">Network Error</Alert.Title>
  <Alert.Description>
    We could not reach the server. Please try again.
  </Alert.Description>
  <Alert.DismissButton onClick={onClose} />
  <Alert.Controls>
    <Button onClick={onRetry}>Retry</Button>
  </Alert.Controls>
</Alert>
```

## Summary

- Inline props for major sections quickly lead to "prop creep."
- Compound components keep `<Alert>` minimal and delegate content/markup details
  to semantically named subcomponents.
- Layout changes or extra features do not require new top-level props on
  `<Alert>`.

This approach scales better and is more maintainable as the design evolves.
