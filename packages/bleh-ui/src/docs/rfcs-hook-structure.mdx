# React Hook Anatomy

> [!WARNING]  
> This proposal requires to set up a **case sensitive volume**, since MacOS is case insensitive by default (It can be done easily with disk utility though).

## Basic Structure

```bash
/hooks
  /useHookName
    │ # Files
    ├── useHookName.types.ts        # typescript type exports
    ├── useHookName.ts              # hook implementation
    ├── useHookName.utils.ts        # optional, utility functions for the hook
    ├── useHookName.test.ts         # unit tests for the hook
    ├── useHookName.mdx             # documentation for the hook
    ├── index.ts                    # barrel file for exports
```

### useHookName.types.ts

Contains type definitions relevant to the hook, such as inputs, outputs, and custom types it uses.

### useHookName.ts

The core implementation of the hook. It defines and exports the hook's logic and any dependencies it might require.

### useHookName.utils.ts

Optional file containing reusable utility functions that support the hook's implementation.

### useHookName.test.ts

Contains unit tests for the hook to ensure its functionality and edge cases are covered.

### useHookName.mdx

Documentation file for the hook, detailing its purpose, usage, and examples.

### index.ts

Exports the hook and any other files (e.g., utilities or types) that should be publicly accessible.
