# Spacing Tokens

Spacing tokens are used to define the space between elements. They are used to create consistent spacing between elements and to ensure that the layout is visually balanced.

> [!NOTE]  
> Every token has a negative equivalent, in case you need to apply a negative margin etc.
> Access the negative version by prependind the token name with a dash. e.g. `-2.5`, `-4`, `-10`, etc.

> [!TIP]  
> To quickly calculate the token value in px, take the token name and multiply it by 4.e.g. `4` = `16px`, `10` = `40px` etc.
