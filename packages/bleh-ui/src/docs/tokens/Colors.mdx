# Colors

In our design system, colors are organized into **scales** based on **contrast** levels to ensure clarity and **usability** across various contexts. Each scale provides a range of tones, from subtle backgrounds to high-contrast elements like text and interactive borders, enabling a consistent and accessible user experience.

The scales are _interchangeable_, meaning a color like red can be swapped with green without losing the intended contrast levels. This flexibility ensures that our designs remain adaptable while maintaining visual hierarchy. Additionally, _the contrast-based approach eliminates the need for a separate "dark mode" design_, as the scales naturally support both light and dark environments seamlessly.

## Scale steps

Below is a list of steps with corresponding use cases for various background, border, and text styles in the design system:

| **Step** | **Use Case**                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | App background                                         |
| 2        | Subtle background                                      |
| 3        | UI element background                                  |
| 4        | Hovered UI element background                          |
| 5        | Active / Selected UI element background                |
| 6        | Subtle borders and separators                          |
| 7        | UI element border and focus rings                      |
| 8        | Hovered UI element border                              |
| 9        | Solid backgrounds                                      |
| 10       | Hovered solid backgrounds                              |
| 11       | Low-contrast text                                      |
| 12       | High-contrast text                                     |
| contrast | a contrast color (black/white) that works on step 9+10 |

## System Colors

Colors available for decoration or reference.

<br />

<ColorScales ids="tomato,red,ruby, crimson, pink, plum, purple, violet, iris,indigo,blue,cyan, teal,jade,green,grass,bronze,gold,brown,orange,amber,yellow,lime,mint,sky" />

## Blacks & Whites

Black and white color scales do not adapt to the selected color-mode. Means a white will always be white, a black will always be black.

> [!TIP]  
> Use the `neutral` color scales if you want to refer to a gray-tone that works on the current background color (light-/dark-mode dependent).

<ColorScales ids="black, white" />

## Brand Colors

Custom colors, tailored to the brand.

<br />

<ColorScales ids="ctViolet, ctTeal, ctYellow" />

## Semantic Colors
