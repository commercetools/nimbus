# React Component Anatomy

## Basic Structure

```bash
/components
  /component-name
    │ # Files
    ├── component-name.types.ts      # typescript type exports
    ├── component-name.recipe.ts     # a recipe file covering basic styles, sizes & variants
    ├── component-name.slots.tsx     # optional, for multi-part components
    ├── component-name.figma.tsx     # code to figma export instructions/definition
    ├── component-name.tsx           # component implementation
    ├── component-name.mdx           # component documentation
    ├── index.ts                     # barrel file for exports
    │ # Folders
    ├── hooks                        # optional, folder for react hooks
    ├── components                   # optional, folder for sub-components
    ├── tests                        # unit tests
    ├── stories                      # storybook stories (screenshot tests)
```

### component-name.types.ts

Exports and/or contains the type definitions for the component.

### component-name.recipe.ts

Contains a single or multi-slot recipe. Covering default styles, sizes, variants and
compound variants for a single or multiple _slots_.

### component-name.slots.ts

A component that has multiple parts, like a Modal (header, body, footer, etc.), will have a .slot.tsx file.
This file will create components with styles attached to them, and will be used in the main component file.

### component-name.tsx

Free of any styling concerns, this file imports the slot-components and connects those
with the headless ui-components.

### component-name.mdx

Contains the documentation for the component. Will provide examples, usage, props, etc.

### index.ts

Exports the component and any other files that need to be exported.

### components

Optional, can contain components that are only used by the parent component.
Structure is the same basic folder structure.

### tests

### stories
