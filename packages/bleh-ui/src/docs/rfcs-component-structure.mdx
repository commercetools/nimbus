# React Component Anatomy

> [!WARNING]  
> This proposal requires to set up a **case sensitive volume**, since MacOS is case insensitive by default (It can be done easily with disk utily though).

## Basic Structure

```bash
/components
  /ComponentName
    │ # Files
    ├── ComponentName.types.ts      # typescript type exports
    ├── ComponentName.recipe.ts     # a recipe file covering basic styles, sizes & variants
    ├── ComponentName.slots.tsx     # optional, for multi-part components
    ├── ComponentName.tsx           # component implementation
    ├── ComponentName.mdx           # component documentation
    ├── index.ts                    # barrel file for exports
    │ # Folders
    ├── hooks                       # optional, folder for react hooks
    ├── components                  # optional, folder for sub-components
    ├── tests                       # unit tests
    ├── stories                     # storybook stories (screenshot tests)
```

### ComponentName.types.ts

Exports and/or contains the type definitions for the component.

### ComponentName.recipe.ts

Contains a single or multi-slot recipe. Covering default styles, sizes, variants and
compound variants for a single or multiple _slots_.

### ComponentName.slots.ts

A component that has multiple parts, like a Modal (header, body, footer, etc.), will have a .slot.tsx file.
This file will create components with styles attached to them, and will be used in the main component file.

### ComponentName.tsx

Free of any styling concerns, this file imports the slot-components and connects those
with the headless ui-components.

### ComponentName.mdx

Contains the documentation for the component. Will provide examples, usage, props, etc.

### index.ts

Exports the component and any other files that need to be exported.

### components

Optional, can contain components that are only used by the parent component.
Structure is the same basic folder structure.

### tests

### stories
