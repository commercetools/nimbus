# Hello!

This repository aims to solve 2 problems:

1. Provide everything necessary to create beautiful, accessible and resilient
   user-interfaces.
2. Document all the bits and pieces that make that happen.

The repository is currently structured into 3 workspaces, 1 app-workspace and 2
package-workspaces.

## Apps

### docs

The doc-app is a developer tool for creating and managing content-driven web
applications by leveraging MDX files, structured metadata, and reusable UI
components.

- **Web Frontend**: The app generates a web-based frontend for browsing and
  interacting with the content.
- **Development Environment**: A development server allows users to edit
  documents and add images directly through their browser.
- **Content Indexing**: The app scans designated folders for MDX documents,
  automatically generating and linking pages.
- **Content Organization**: Frontmatter in MDX files provides metadata for
  structuring menus and annotating content, enabling flexible organization.
- **UI Component Integration**: The app utilizes components from
  `@bleh-ui/react`, demonstrating how to create polished frontends with this UI
  library.

## Packages

Currently this two packages contain the mentioned bits and pieces, reusable
across several frontends:

### @bleh-ui/react

This package contains react components & hooks, as well as a ct-tailored
default-theme.

### @bleh-ui/icons

This package contains icons for many different scenarios.
