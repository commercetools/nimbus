# Headless UI comparison

This page is about comparing the same ux-concept across several headless ui libraries.

## Ideal flow

1. A slot-recipe for the individual parts of a component is created (`slider.recipe.tsx`)
2. For every slot, a proxy react-component is created (`slider.parts.tsx`)
3. The headless ui libraries will use the individual parts to assemble the final component

## Slider

### Radix

- the offset-position of the slider thumb is already accurately calculated by radix (taking the thumb-width into account)
- easy to style, no hacks necessary

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(50);
  return (
    <div>
      <RadixSlider min={0} max={100} value={value} onValueChange={v=>setValue(v)} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### React ARIA

- less "slots" to style (e.g. no range element)
- not as easy to syle as radix, but practice will make perfect
- throws console warnings when there are a11y issues:

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(50);
  return (
    <div>
      <label id="demo-label">React ARIA Slider label</label>
      <ReactAriaSlider size="sm" min={0} max={100} value={value} onValueChange={v=>setValue(v)} aria-labelledby="demo-label"  />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### DatePicker (React ARIA)

```jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(50);
  return (
    <div>
      <DatePicker/>
    </div>
  )
}
```
