# Architecture Overview

## Project Overview

Nimbus is a multi-package design system monorepo containing React UI components,
design tokens, icons, and documentation. It uses pnpm workspaces and is built
with TypeScript, React Aria Components, and Chakra UI v3.

**Key Architecture:**

- **Monorepo Structure**: Uses pnpm workspaces with packages and apps
  directories
- **Component Library**: React components with WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
  implementation using React Aria patterns
- **Design System**: Design token-based theming system with Chakra UI v3 recipes
- **Internationalization**: Compile-time message compilation using
  `@internationalized/string` with `LocalizedStringDictionary` and Transifex
  support
- **Documentation**: JSDoc-extracted API documentation site and Storybook for
  component development
