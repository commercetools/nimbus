# Button

Displays a Button.

> [!NOTE]  
> The \`<Button/>\` component uses the native [HTML button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) as DOM element.
>
> You can freely use native button attributes and customize its styling with the props below.

## Basic Usage

No props are required to use the Button component. If unconfigured it will pick up defaults
for \`variant\`, \`size\`, and \`colorPalette\`. Defaults can be set in the \`recipe\`-file.

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => <Button>I am a Button</Button>
\`\`\`

## Features

### Accessibility

To abstract away the differences between mouse, touch and keyboard interactions, the Button component
supports \`onPress*\` props. The misc \`onPress*\` props (\`onPress\`, \`onPressStart\`, \`onPressEnd\`, etc.) provide a more seamless and inclusive user experience
across different devices and input methods:

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => <Button aria-label="ne need to click this" onPress={()=>alert()} onPressEnd={()=>{}}>I am still a button</Button>
\`\`\`

### Change the underlying DOM-element

The Button component uses the native [HTML button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)
by default, but supports rendering as a different tag to the dom. Use the \`asChild\` and the tag you want to render as only child.

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => (
  <Button asChild>
    <a href="http://www.commercetools.com" target="_blank">I am a button in disguise</a>
  </Button>
)
\`\`\`

### Data-Attributes

The Button component supports forwarding arbitrary \`data-*\` attributes. This can be useful for tracking tools.

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => <Button data-foo="bar">I can have data-attributes</Button>
\`\`\`

## Customizing the look

### Sizes

Buttons come in different sizes, sizing a button is done by setting the \`size\` prop. Setting the size
has no effect on the variant or color of the Button.

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => {

  const sizes = ['2xs', 'xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl', '2xl'].reverse();

  return (
    <Stack direction="horizontal" alignItems="center">
      {sizes.map(size => (
        <Button key={size} size={size}>'{size}' Button</Button>
      ))}
    </Stack>
  )
}
\`\`\`

### Variants

Look how the buttons change their appearance but not their size. It is important
that the variant has no effect on the size. Only then it can be guaranteed that
buttons with different variants can be used and displayed next to each other.

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => {

  const variants = ['solid', 'subtle', 'outline', 'ghost', 'plain']

  return (
    <Stack direction="horizontal">
      {variants.map(variant => (
        <Button key={variant} variant={variant}>'{variant}' Button</Button>
      ))}
    </Stack>
  )
}
\`\`\`

### Colors

Since the different \`variants\` operate purely on contrast level differences (think: dark & light elements),
the \`colorPalette\` prop can be used to colorize the Button.

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const variants = ["solid", "subtle", "outline", "ghost", "link", "plain"];
  const colors = ["neutral", "primary", "info", "success", "danger", "error"];

  return (
    <Stack>
      {colors.map((color) => (
        <Stack key={color} direction="horizontal">
          {variants.map((variant) => (
            <Button colorPalette={color} key={variant} variant={variant}>
              '{variant}' Button
            </Button>
          ))}
        </Stack>
      ))}
    </Stack>
  );
};
\`\`\`

## Responsive widths

The [\`width\` style-prop](/style-props/sizing#width) can be used to set the width of the \`Button\`.
In combination with a \`Stack\` you could display the \`Button\`s side-by-side or on top of each other
depending on the available screen-estate.

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Stack direction={{
      base: "column",
      md: "row"
    }}>
      <Button width={{
        base: 'full',
        md: '1/2'
      }} colorPalette="success" variant="solid">
        <Icons.Check /> Yes
      </Button>
      <Button width={{
        base: 'full',
        md: '1/2'
      }} colorPalette="error" variant="solid">
        <Icons.X /> No
      </Button>
    </Stack>
  );
};
\`\`\`

## Icons

Right now icons can be just dropped into the button, they are sized like regular text and thus
adjust their own-size according to the \`size\` prop.

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const sizes = ["2xs", "xs", "sm", "md", "lg", "xl", "2xl"].reverse();

  return (
    <Stack>
      {sizes.map((size) => (
        <Stack key={size} direction="horizontal">
          <Button size={size} colorPalette="success" variant="solid">
            <Icons.Check /> Yes
          </Button>
          <Button size={size} colorPalette="error" variant="solid">
            <Icons.X /> No
          </Button>
          <Button size={size} colorPalette="neutral" variant="ghost">
            <Box animation="spin" asChild><Icons.Loader/></Box> Maybe
          </Button>
        </Stack>
      ))}
    </Stack>
  );
};
\`\`\`

## Props

Here is still chaos. I am not sure if parsing the types is the right way to do it. This is already a filtered selection, but there is still a lot
of "bycatch" (native HTML element props, style-props, chakra-specifics ...) in the types that is not needed.
Maybe cherry-picking the props to display is the way to go.

# Headless UI comparison

This page is about comparing the same ux-concept across several headless ui libraries.

## Ideal flow

1. A slot-recipe for the individual parts of a component is created (\`slider.recipe.tsx\`)
2. For every slot, a proxy react-component is created (\`slider.parts.tsx\`)
3. The headless ui libraries will use the individual parts to assemble the final component

## Slider

### Radix

- the offset-position of the slider thumb is already accurately calculated by radix (taking the thumb-width into account)
- easy to style, no hacks necessary

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(50);
  return (
    <div>
      <RadixSlider min={0} max={100} value={value} onValueChange={v=>setValue(v)} />
    </div>
  )
}
\`\`\`

### React ARIA

- less "slots" to style (e.g. no range element)
- not as easy to syle as radix, but practice will make perfect
- throws console warnings when there are a11y issues:

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(50);
  return (
    <div>
      <label id="demo-label">React ARIA Slider label</label>
      <ReactAriaSlider size="sm" min={0} max={100} value={value} onValueChange={v=>setValue(v)} aria-labelledby="demo-label"  />
    </div>
  )
}
\`\`\`

### DatePicker (React ARIA)

\`\`\`jsx-live
const App = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(50);
  return (
    <div>
      <DatePicker/>

# Hello!

This repository aims to solve 2 problems:

1. Provide everything necessary to create beautiful, accessible and resilient user-interfaces.
2. Document all the bits and pieces that make that happen.

The repository is currently structured into 3 workspaces, 1 app-workspace and 2 package-workspaces.

## Apps

### docs

The doc-app is a developer tool for creating and managing content-driven web applications by leveraging MDX files, structured metadata, and reusable UI components.

- **Web Frontend**: The app generates a web-based frontend for browsing and interacting with the content.
- **Development Environment**: A development server allows users to edit documents and add images directly through their browser.
- **Content Indexing**: The app scans designated folders for MDX documents, automatically generating and linking pages.
- **Content Organization**: Frontmatter in MDX files provides metadata for structuring menus and annotating content, enabling flexible organization.
- **UI Component Integration**: The app utilizes components from \`@bleh-ui/react\`, demonstrating how to create polished frontends with this UI library.

## Packages

Currently this two packages contain the mentioned bits and pieces, reusable across several frontends:

### @bleh-ui/react

This package contains react components & hooks, as well as a ct-tailored default-theme.

### @bleh-ui/icons

# Markdown / MDX Stress Test

This is a page to stress test markdown & mdx syntax usages to see if everything renders without issues.

## Basic Markdown

BAsic markdown is supported.

### Headings

See the bold Text above? This is a heading. Not gonna demonstrate them, they are used everwhere on a page, but this is what you'd use in markdown or mdx files to write one:

\`\`\`markdown
# H1 Most important

## H2 Heading

### H3 Heading

#### H4 Heading

##### H5 Heading

###### H6 Least important
\`\`\`

### Emphasizing Text

#### Italic Text

_Italic text_ is done with underscores \`_String to highlight_\`

#### Bold Text

**Bold text** is done with double asterisks \`**String to highlight**\`

#### Bold + Italic Text

**_Bold + Italic text_** is done with tripple asterisks \`***String to highlight***\`

### Code

Code can be displayed inline or in a code-block, use single backticks for inline-code or tripple backticks for code blocks.

Look at this: \`export const App = () => <div>App</div>\` this was inline code.

And here is a code-block:

\`\`\`jsx
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>App</p>
    </div>
  );
};
\`\`\`

### Blockquote

This is how a regular blockquote looks. There are more variants of blockquotes but they are belonging to the Github flavored Markdown though.

> Sugar plum shortbread dragée chocolate bar lollipop. Bonbon soufflé cupcake cotton candy bear claw muffin tiramisu

### Links

Link look pretty basic [tiramisu croissant gummies](http://www.asdasdsd.com)

### Images

Images work as well.

### component-name.types.ts

Exports and/or contains the type definitions for the component.

### component-name.recipe.ts

Contains a single or multi-slot recipe. Covering default styles, sizes, variants and
compound variants for a single or multiple _slots_.

### component-name.slots.ts

A component that has multiple parts, like a Modal (header, body, footer, etc.), will have a .slot.tsx file.
This file will create components with styles attached to them, and will be used in the main component file.

### component-name.tsx

Free of any styling concerns, this file imports the slot-components and connects those
with the headless ui-components.

### component-name.mdx

Contains the documentation for the component. Will provide examples, usage, props, etc.

### index.ts

Exports the component and any other files that need to be exported.

### components

Optional, can contain components that are only used by the parent component.
Structure is the same basic folder structure.

# Animations

This page provides a list of tokens for applying ready made animations (shorthands)
or creating custom animations or transitions by combining keyframe animations with durations
and easings.

## Shorthands

The following list of shorthand tokens can be used as \`animation\` property value, they combine
a keyframe animation with duration and easing for a reusable animation definition.

<GenericTokenTableDemo category="animations" demoProperty="animation" />

## Keyframe Animations

CSS keyframe animations define animations as a sequence of steps, each with its own set of properties. They allow for more complex, multi-step animations that can be controlled with keyframes and timing functions.

<KeyframeTokenDemo />

## Durations

Durations define **how long** an animation takes to complete one cycle, directly impacting the perception of speed and fluidity.

Short durations create snappy, quick interactions that feel responsive but can risk appearing abrupt. Longer durations allow for smoother, more deliberate motion but can feel sluggish if overused.

Finding the right balance is key—durations should match the context and intent of the interaction. They’re measured in seconds or milliseconds and are often paired with easings to create harmonious, intentional animations.

<DurationTokenDemo />

## Easings

_Easings_ determine **the rate of change** of an animation over time, essentially
defining how an animation transitions between its start and end states.

Instead of moving linearly, animations can accelerate, decelerate, or follow complex
curves, making the motion feel more dynamic and natural.

This is achieved through mathematical easing functions, like linear interpolation or bezier curves, which map progress over time to the visible change in animation properties. It controls the "rhythm" of the animation, ensuring it feels fluid or deliberate depending on the desired effect.

# Breakpoints

Breakpoints define specific screen widths at which your design should adapt to provide an optimal viewing experience for users. They are thresholds that represent a starting point for changes in styling, such as font sizes, layouts, and visibility of elements.

Each breakpoint is a minimum width, meaning that styles associated with that breakpoint apply to screen sizes equal to or larger than the specified width. The styles remain active until the next breakpoint threshold is reached.

## Tokens

The breakpoints **start** at the specified value and **end** at the next breakpoint value.
The following breakpoint-tokens are supported:

# Colors

In our design system, colors are organized into **scales** based on **contrast** levels to ensure clarity and **usability** across various contexts. Each scale provides a range of tones, from subtle backgrounds to high-contrast elements like text and interactive borders, enabling a consistent and accessible user experience.

The scales are _interchangeable_, meaning a color like red can be swapped with green without losing the intended contrast levels. This flexibility ensures that our designs remain adaptable while maintaining visual hierarchy. Additionally, _the contrast-based approach eliminates the need for a separate "dark mode" design_, as the scales naturally support both light and dark environments seamlessly.

## Scale steps

Below is a list of steps with corresponding use cases for various background, border, and text styles in the design system:

| **Step** | **Use Case**                                           |

# Spacing Tokens

Spacing tokens are used to define the space between elements. They are used to create consistent spacing between elements and to ensure that the layout is visually balanced.

> [!NOTE]  
> Every token has a negative equivalent, in case you need to apply a negative margin etc.
> Access the negative version by prependind the token name with a dash. e.g. \`-2.5\`, \`-4\`, \`-10\`, etc.

<br />

<br />

> [!TIP]  
> To quickly calculate the token value in px, take the token name and multiply it by 4.e.g. \`4\` = \`16px\`, \`10\` = \`40px\` etc.

# useCopyToClipboard

Copy text to a user's clipboard.

## Usage

\`\`\`jsx
const Demo = () => {
  const [text, setText] = React.useState("");
  const [state, copyToClipboard] = useCopyToClipboard();

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />

    </div>
  );
};
\`\`\`

## Reference

\`\`\`js
const [{ value, error, noUserInteraction }, copyToClipboard] =
  useCopyToClipboard();
\`\`\`

- \`value\` &mdash; value that was copied to clipboard, undefined when nothing was copied.
- \`error\` &mdash; caught error when trying to copy to clipboard.
- \`noUserInteraction\` &mdash; boolean indicating if user interaction was required to copy the value to clipboard to expose full API from underlying [\`copy-to-clipboard\`](https://github.com/sudodoki/copy-to-clipboard) library.

# useHotkeys

This hook allows you to listen to hotkeys in a declarative way and execute a callback function once the user pressed down the given hotkey.

## Basic Usage

Import the \`useHotkeys\` hook from the package:

\`\`\`js
import { useHotkeys } from "@bleh-ui/react";
\`\`\`

## Simple Hotkey

The most basic usage for the hook is to assign a hotkey you want to listen to and a callback to get executed once the user
hits that key.

\`\`\`jsx-live
import { useHotkeys } from "@bleh-ui/react";

const App = () => {
  useHotkeys("a", () => alert("Key a was pressed"));

  return <span>Press the a key to see it work.</span>;
};
\`\`\`
